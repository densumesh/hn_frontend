The premise of the book seems to be that you're going to learn about how to run a startup by reading about successful ones-- that is, you're going to look at a bunch of successful startups, and say Hmm, what makes for a successful startup?       Another way to put it is that you're trying to train a classifier-- how do you tell whether a startup is going to succeed? Well, if it has a, b, and c qualities in x, y, and z amounts. However, a key part in training classifiers is having negative as well as positive examples. It seems that from reading *just* about successful startups, you could incorrectly infer a bunch of necessary qualities for successful startups, when in fact those are qualities of all startups, or those are just qualities of the sample taken, and focusing on them is bogus. Having no direct experience in the matter, I can't give good examples, but it seems like you could fall victim to a breakdancing chicken problem: (made up example) all the interviewed startups wrote software, so writing software is an important step towards having a successful startups.

I was one of the lead developers on that project. :-)    As for what happens to the returned items? They're sold off in the company employee store for a few dollars. If the company makes stipulations about the use of their logo, then a patch is applied over it, before selling to the employees, to protect the customers brand. As I recall, most customers don't mind.",comment,

The main page (http://news.ycombinator.com/) had only &#34;up&#34; arrows.

He converted HotOrNot from an S-corporation to a C-corporation.  You can certainly reinvest profits from an S-corporation into the business or pay out profits from a C-corporation as dividends, but the incentives go different ways.  S-corp earnings are taxed as ordinary income (none of the double-taxation of corporate profits) and S-corps can't give out different classes of shares, so there's an incentive to distribute the profits out to the shareholders.  C-corp earnings are taxed once at the corporate level and then once as dividend earnings, yet they can have multiple classes of shareholders.  The incentive is to build up the business and eventually seek an IPO, acquisition, or other liquidity event.

The article has an interesting take on working out the dividing line between founders that are *involved* VS those who are *committed*.  But is this a good enough test?    I found out recently the distinction between 'involved' & 'committed' when a co-founder ditched out prefering to do a Phd (in the exact same area of the product) rather go the hard yards, build a product then sell it. Why? I can only guess. The Phd route could be perceived as less risky, higher prestige over the entrepreneurial route.  Maybe because all the &#34;chicks dig Phd's in CompSci&#34; ?    Using the above test the co-founder would pass. So how do you,  &#34;evaluate if a co-founder is committed over the entire product development timeline before any perceived payback&#34; ?

In my experience, one of the largest hurdles to user adoption is getting something useful from the site.  If a user is able to see the value of the service *before* putting something into it, they are more likely to understand the offering and accepting the reward for 5 minutes worth of forms.  There are so many services competing for users attention and everyone of them are fighting for their niche.

Yes, it is a tool, and I do use it - under the normal circumstance - as an individual using a tool he own privately.

Non-compensatory: when a customer is making a decision, and no combination of additional features make up for a lack of the feature they really want (e.g. it doesn't matter how cool the phone is if I can't play mp3s).  Versus compensatory (e.g., well, news.ycombinator doesn't use ajax, but the fact that it's focused, spam free, and easy on the eyes makes up for it...)<p>You can translate the concepts to simple additive math and work from there.<p>Brilliant to be able to predict peoples' decision between hundreds of competing products based on answering just a few questions.",comment,

sharpshoot,,950,,,1172368210,,"Another important thing to realise venture capital is only appropriate at a certain lifestage of a company where the founders are keen to grow at extrodinary rates in a short time. Not having expectations of growing a startup to Facebook, Google or Bebo size you are going to be wasting a VC's time. This is no mean feat - you have to be mentally prepared to grow and scale a company like mad and similarly your startup must have proved its case for being able to scale.<p>Whats the best way to know if your startup is ready? build a prototype, get some traction, look at the numbers, measure, experiment then measure again. If you truly are going to scale (and you are growing at 1% a day) and you've experimented enough that you've found a suitable path you'll end up needing money of the VC scale.<p>It doesn't cost much to sit around and build something. Go and test it - figure out what people want first - change your assumptions and above all PROVE that if you scaled your site it'd be worth it for investors. You don't need VC yet to start something and test it out - If it comes to that point well thats something to think about.<p>I'm reminded of the story Michael Birch of Bebo tells - they built something, put it out there off the traffic of birthday alarm and experimented with features. Every time a feature added to the growth of the site and got a noticeable increase in users they kept it and tried something else which also contributed to the growth. By experimenting, measuring and then iterating for things which correlated for growth they ended up on the right path. When they had 5 million users and were growing month on month they had the numbers to prove themselves. They took $15m from Benchmark capital. The bottom line - you'll know when you are ready: just go prove the numbers.",comment,

reitzensteinm,,967,,,1172377825,,"Yeah, it's probably not so applicable to consumer facing internet companies since the approach really needs a business to buy into the idea (much more willing to preorder, a single sale could fund the entire development). <p>Although maybe that depends on what you are creating. I could see something like Hotmail or Skype being bootstrapped with this method, because those services are useful to both individuals and businesses. Back then, email from any PC with the internet or free international voice calls would have been things that many businesses would have paid for (and still would, if there weren't so many free alternatives now). Even Reddit got its NYT deal soon after starting which pushed it into the black, did it not? (not rhetorical - I don't know much about their history so tell me if I'm wrong!)<p>There is the problem of loss of focus though. If a company like Hotmail started in '95, realised it could make millions selling their product to companies and focused on that (sales, turnkey servers for easy installation), they would probably only get a few years of that income at most before they are dethroned by a company that just focused on making the best web based email possible. So it would be a bit of a local maxmimum. Is this more dangerous than the loss of focus of doing something totally unhelpful/unrelated to the main product to bring in some cash (contracting, searching for investors) while simultaneously working on the final product?

Hes got just the thing.<p>Videos have multiplied on social networks like YouTube and MySpace as well as on news and entertainment sites because of the emergence of video-sharing, user-generated video, free digital storage and broadband and Wi-Fi networks.<p>Today, owing to the proliferation of large video files, video accounts for more than 60 percent of the traffic on the Internet, according to CacheLogic, a company in Cambridge, England, that sells media delivery systems to Internet service providers. I imagine that within two years it will be 98 percent, says Hui Zhang, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.<p>But search engines  like Google  that were developed during the first, text-based era of the Web do a poor job of searching through this rising sea of video. Thats because they dont search the videos themselves, but rather things associated with them, including the text of a Web page, the metadata that computers use to display or understand pages (like keywords or the semantic tags that describe different content), video-file suffixes (like .mpeg or .avi), or captions or subtitles.<p>None of these methods are very satisfactory. Many Internet videos have little or obscure text, and clips often have no or misleading metadata. Modern video players do not reveal video-file suffixes, and captions and subtitles imperfectly capture the spoken words in a video.<p>The difficulties of knowing which videos are where challenge the growth of Internet video. If there are going to be hundreds of millions of hours of video content online, Mr. Chandratillake said, we need to have an efficient, scalable way to search through it.<p>Mr. Chandratillakes history is unusual for Silicon Valley. He was born in Sri Lanka in 1977 and divided his childhood among England and various countries in South Asia where his father, a professor of nuclear chemistry, worked. Then he studied distributed processing at Kings College, Cambridge, before becoming the chief technology officer of Autonomy, a company that specializes in something called meaning-based computing. This background possibly suggested an original approach to search when he founded Blinkx in 2004.<p>Mr. Chandratillakes solution does not reject any existing video search methods, but supplements them by transcribing the words uttered in a video, and searching them. This is an achievement: effective speech recognition is a nontrivial problem, in the language of computer scientists.<p>Blinkxs speech-recognition technology employs neural networks and machine learning using hidden Markov models, a method of statistical analysis in which the hidden characteristics of a thing are guessed from what is known.<p>Mr. Chandratillake calls this method contextual search, and he says it works so well because the meanings of the sounds of speech are unclear when considered by themselves. Consider the phrase recognize speech,  he wrote in an e-mail message. Its phonemes (rek-un-nise-peach) are incredibly similar to those contained in the phrase wreck a nice beach. Our systems use our knowledge of which words typically appear in which contexts and everything we know about a given clip to improve our ability to guess what each phoneme actually means.<p>While neural networks and machine learning are not new, their application to video search is unique to Blinkx, and very clever.<p>How good is blinkx search? When you visit blinkx.com, the first thing you see is the video wall, 25 small, shimmering tiles, each displaying a popular video clip, indexed that hour. (The wall provides a powerful sense of the collective mind of our popular culture.)<p>To experiment, I typed in the phrase Chronic  WHAT  cles of Narnia, the shout-out in the Saturday Night Live digital short called Lazy Sunday, a rap parody of two New York slackers. I wanted a phrase that a Web surfer would know more readily than the real title of a video. I also knew that Lazy Sunday, for all its cultish fame, would be hard to find: NBC Universal had freely released the rap parody on the Internet after broadcasting it in December 2005, but last month the company insisted that YouTube pull it.<p>Nonetheless, Blinkx found eight instances of Lazy Sunday when I tried it last week. By contrast, Google Video found none. Typing Lazy Sunday into the keyword search box on Googles home page produced hundreds of results  but many were commentaries about the video, and many had nothing to do with Saturday Night Live.<p>Blinkx, which has raised more than $12.5 million from angel investors, earns money by licensing its technology to other sites. Although Blinkx has more than 80 such partners, including Microsoft, Playboy, Reuters and MTV, it rarely discloses the terms of its deals. Mr. Chandratillake said some licensees pay Blilnkx directly while others share revenue and some do both. Blinkx has revealed the details of one deal: ITN, a British news broadcaster, will share the revenue generated by advertising inserted in its videos.<p>For all of Blinkxs level coolness, there are at least three obvious obstacles to the companys success.<p>First, because Google Video is not much good now doesnt mean it wont get better: after all, when Blinkx was founded, it first applied machine learning to searching the desktops of personal computers, a project that was abandoned when Google and Microsoft released their own desktop search bars.<p>Second, even if Google improbably fails to develop effective video search, the field will still be crowded: TruVeo, Flurl, ClipBlast and other start-ups are all at work on different subsets of the market.<p>Finally, Blinkx might not go far enough in searching the content of videos: the company searches their sounds, but not their images.<p>THIS last objection is the most serious.<p>Because Blinkx emphasizes speech recognition, there is a great amount of multimedia content that they cannot address, like photographs, said John R. Smith, a senior manager in the intelligent information management department of I.B.M.s T. J. Watson Research Center in Hawthorne, N.Y. But whats worse, speech is not a very good indicator of whats being shown in a video.<p>Mr. Smith says he has been working on an experimental video search engine called Marvel, which also uses machine learning but organizes visual information as well as speech.<p>Still, at least for now, Blinkx leads video search: it searches more than seven million hours of video and is the largest repository of digital video on the Web.<p>Search is our navigation, our interface to the Internet, said John Battelle, chief of Federated Media Publishing and author of The Search, an account of the rise of Google. With Blinkx, we may have such an interface for digital video, and be a little closer to Mr. Chandratillakes vision of a universal remote control.<p>Jason Pontin is the editor in chief and publisher of Technology Review, a magazine and Web site owned by M.I.T.

When you start &#39;scaling out&#39; to a bigger array of cheap hardware, you introduce complications that make your site harder to maintain and improve.

As I&#39;m sure you can imagine, there have been improvements in the field since then.  To be completely honest, I don&#39;t stay on top of search applied to speech, but the keyword you want is &#34;Spoken Document Retrieval&#34; (SDR).  Ciprian Chelba and TJ Hazen do cool stuff in this area; they are giving a tutorial at ICASSP this year SDR.<p>An aside.  Both of these approaches use the fact that when you process speech, you essentially form a graph of words (or phonemes).  Paths through the graph represent possible transcriptions.  So, since graph is a denser, richer thing to search than the transcript, and we&#39;ve got graph algorithms sitting around, there are neat tricks you can do to build a search engine index for speech...  <p>I&#39;ve recently been reading some interesting work that uses locality-sensitive hashing to search audio.

jwecker,,1181,[1412],,1172496040,,"That&#39;s definitely part of it- they are heavyweight threads or processes (no matter how you configure it) (rather than lightweight erlang threads).  I would imagine the bigger problem here, however, is context switching.  Because Apache (and most other servers) use OS threading or forking, the entire state of the current process (let&#39;s say) has to be put aside and then restored later, maybe after only a few milliseconds- because the OS isn&#39;t going to presume anything about the state of that process.  In Erlang&#39;s concurrency model it simply runs 20 (or so, I think- anyway some static number) functions and then goes to another process.<p>Because the functions are, uh, functional there is almost no state to save and restore when there is a context switch.  Also because things like iteration are done with recursion- the 20 functions and then context switch doesn&#39;t get hung up on some loop somewhere.  The faster the OS tries to keep switching between processes, the more overhead it introduces.<p>BTW, this is why in my opinion you don&#39;t see a lot of other systems duplicating this sort of concurrency model- because there are some language &#34;limitations&#34; (recursion only, for example) that make it possible.<p>Most apache, erlang, or kernel hackers would know way more about this than I do, of course.",comment,

And there are two fundamental problems.<p>The first problem is the institutional structure of the US education system. In my experience, tech-savvy instructors rarely look for a generic CMS solution. And those without much tech experience resist change unless it is forced upon them because they are already good at what they do and change disrupts their ability to get their jobs done. Blackboard gets around this inertia by selling to university and school administrations, which then push the technology out throughout campuses. It is a top-down sales regime. The company has non-compete clauses so that instructors cannot adopt other systems even if they wanted to.

They&#39;ve won the war as far as universities are concerned.  However, universities generally do the job of teaching very well.  You also don&#39;t hear of fatal university shootings often (If ever?  I haven&#39;t looked.)  I&#39;m in it to improve the lives and education of high school students.  If I manage to better just one student&#39;s life, then I&#39;ll consider it mission accomplished.<p>High schools are very much open game.  They&#39;re open game because they can&#39;t typically afford the huge sums of money that universities can.  I plan to dominate the low end by creating a product that&#39;s simple, efficient, and inexpensive; something that every teacher would want.  I&#39;m not competing with Blackboard.  I&#39;m sidestepping them.<p>I agree that teachers have methods that they&#39;ve employed for years to teach students.  But part of that is exactly the problem.  When something is done exactly the same for years on end, it gets stale.  A teacher would have -fun- with my product, exploring other&#39;s ideas and communities.  I plan to make them happy.<p>They may be reluctant to use my product, but I plan to be with my two cofounders, on foot, visiting local high schools as soon as I have a feature set that&#39;s useful, and spending time with individual teachers to show them how they might benefit from it.  Then it&#39;s up to the teachers whether or not they&#39;ll use Classbug, but if I&#39;ve done my job well, they&#39;ll most certainly want to.<p>Shawn",comment,

Alex3917,,1380,"[1429, 1432]",,1172593943,,"It&#39;s interesting to look at the differences between the way Dexter&#39;s doing it and the way we do it. Dexter appears to be lifting his foot straight up off the ground and then falling forward to produce the forward motion. <p>The way humans walk is exactly the opposite. The toes are at a different angle from the foot (when walking), so that our feet effectively look something like ___/ , with the underscores being the foot and the / being the toes. We then transition from the ___ part of the foot to the / part of the foot and push forward, and land flat footed with the other foot. For whatever speed you are going, there is a proper ratio between landing on the ___ part of the foot and pushing off the / part of the foot, and that&#39;s where balance comes from. That is, the faster the acceleration of the fall, the faster you transition from ___ to / .<p>So in humans, balance comes from the way one step connects to the next step, whereas Dexter appears to be treating each step as a discrete unit, where it has to attain balance at the end of one step before going on to the next step.<p>If you actually have to balance yourself after each individual step instead of using the next step for balance, the problem seems in some ways to be much harder. <p>Also, the balance problem is greatly compounded by the small steps Dexter takes. Compare this to doing lunges. When you do a lunge, you basically take a long stride forward and then sink into it, all while keeping your torso perfectly upright. This gives you a much bigger platform for stability. As terrain gets steeper, the way humans walk becomes more like a lunge for this reason. <p>So my guess is that taking one tiny step and then balancing is the hardest part of this problem, because you have the least tools at your disposal. For example, you can&#39;t use the next step to balance you. However, once you can do the last step of the sequence, all the preceding steps working backward from the last one get progressively easier.<p>I don&#39;t know anything about robotics, but as an athlete and sports physiology geek I find the problem interesting.",comment,

vegashacker,,1478,[1582],,1172644475,,"I'm rusty on my Python, but I'd have to guess that no, Python's dynamic features don't get you the kind of power that Pascal's talking about.  The key thing to realize is that any particular feature that your language has doesn't necessarily matter.  For example, Python may happend to have a built-in way of doing<p>(with-input-file (in ""myfile.txt"")   (do-something in))<p>In Python, this might look like<p>withInputFile in ""myfile.txt"":  doSomething(in)<p>(hey, I told you I was rusty on my Python...especially my totally made up Python!)<p>So maybe the feature came built-in to Python, in which case you're lucky--Guido happened to decide to implement this feature.  But what if he hadn't?  Well, just write your own abstraction.  Obviously, Python can open files and do stuff with the file's contents.  So it seems logical that you should be able to create an abstraction which saves you from writing the same boilerplate that you do every time you open an input file.  Unfortunately, there are some abstractions that *you just can't write* in most languages (including Python).  This file open example is a good one.  Here's another example, in the form of a programming challenge:<p>In Python, create an abstraction called ""debugExpr"" that consumes an expression E, and then does two things:   1) prints ""Expression E = V"", where E is the given expression, and V is the value E evaluates to.   2) returns the value V.<p>For example,<p>%python% 6 * debugExpr(2+3)<p>Expression 2+3 = 5<p>30<p>I'm betting you can't implement debugExpr in Python.  So assuming Guido didn't extend the language to implement this feature, you're pretty much SOL.  It's a shame because debugExpr, I think, is pretty darn useful.  It means that you can take any expression in your code and ""inspect it"", without worrying about adjusting the structure of your program, and without affecting its semantics.  Without debugExpr, I'd have to change my example code to be something like this to get the same result:<p>print ""Expression 2+3 =""<p>tmp = 2+3<p>print tmp<p>6 * tmp<p> YUCK!",comment,

Giving that talent freedom and incentive should make Yahoo more competitive. <p>But so many of the advantages of real startups are unlikely to apply. What strikes me as one of the biggest factors is that this seems unlikely to draw in too much external talent.

You're not really encouraged to do little projects, something that a startup might do. Instead, you're encouraged to contribute to the bottom line of Google, which severely limits the kind of things you can work on (i.e., ""do search or you're wasting your time""). This is compounded by the fact that your 20% time is inconsistently factored into your employee evaluation (for better or for worse).",comment,

Unlike its web counterparts, your audience cannot simply use your software. This is by far the biggest hurdle.

Go back to marketing 101. <p>Invest the time (not money) to see how you can improve the communication of your product on your site. Then concentrate on placing your product with Cnet.

lucks,,1980,,,1172932580,,"It is interesting to point out that Reddit already tried this platform for comments on scientific papers.  arxiv.org has long been acknowledged as a forerunner to scientific e-publishing and is in fact a one-stop-shop for many subfields of physics, computer science, and almost all of mathematics.  We thought it would be the perfect place to try to do something like what you suggested: to use a Reddit-like interface to collect comments and discussions on scientific literature.  So Reddit set it up at arxiv.reddit.org.<p>As you can see, there is not much happening.  In fact, the main lesson learned here was not that a reddit-like platform is not ideal to this type of knowledge pooling, but that the scientific community is in general skeptical about this type of information sharing.  We did not require email address validation for logins (hence the spam you can see up there), but we did talk about it with a lot of people and there were good arguments on both sides.  I talked with physicists, biologists and mathematicians about using this type of site, and the replies were mostly those of insecurity about sharing incomplete ideas: both because they might be wrong (and not many scientists like that), and because if they were right, they would rather keep it to themselves and publish it.<p>Actually Paul Ginsparg, the creator of arxiv.org, kind of warned us before we launched that it would take mostly a huge grass-roots effort to get scientists going on something like this.  He was right, and from listening to some of his stories about how he started arxiv.org, it apparently took him over 5 years of grass-roots convincing before it took off, despite being clearly a very good idea.<p>If you are interested in scientific knowledge sharing, with an eye towards collaboration, check out openwetware.org, which uses the mediawiki wiki platform.  Note that they actually do require account authentication, so have a lot less spam issues at this point.

Well we have prototyped the idea and would like to start building it for real, and we kept getting caught by Rails when we tried to go against the grain.<p>So we started to look into other web application frameworks, and turned up a lot of comparison between two python-based frameworks, Django and Turbogears, with Rails.  Although they were all very outdated, they all boiled down to using a python-based framework if you want more of the internals exposed (because you have include a lot more code to explicitly specify what you want to do), and use Rails if you don't want these details exposed.  To be fair, you can always dive into the rails code itself to look at the internals, so it is more of a question of how you want your application code to look.<p>As I don't have too much Turbogears experience at this point, I would gladly welcome a re-analysis of the comparison from someone who does.

nostrademons,,2030,,,1172950537,,"Multiple founders != multiple programmers.<p>Many startups with multiple founders have one founder do most or all of the programming work.  As I understand it, Reddit is like this: Steve does the coding while Alexis does all the other miscellaneous work.  Sun had 4 founders, but Bill Joy did the programming.  AFAIK, DHH did most of the initial programming for 37signals, though they obviously have more now.  Their advice (in ""Getting Real"") was to start with one programmer, one designer, and one person who could do swing work - a little server admin here, a little CSS work there.  This also squares with Fred Brooks's advice in Mythical Man Month - a programming team should be organized like a surgical team, with one lead programmer and 5-7 people running support so he has no distractions.<p>There're some big advantages to this structure, mostly involving communications overhead.  With one programmer, you don't need to coordinate who does what.  You don't need to explain what needs to be done.  You don't waste time fixing broken interfaces.  You can move quickly and add whatever features the customers want.<p>I've worked for two startups that have both suffered by starting with a team of 4-5 (1 founder + 3-4 employees) instead of a single founder.  It's very hard to get everyone on the same page on the requirements, particularly if the employees don't know the domain well.

If it is a tech company, I really think they both have to have real tech expertise.  It has little to do with just having someone else to do the programming- in both of those partnerships the partner was more than willing to defer to me on all technical matters that they perceived to be technical matters.<p>In a tech company, though, _everything_ is a technical matter- for example- marketing.  Early adopters for 99% of tech products are geeks- if you are not one then you do not understand the market (hence all those MBA lead failures of the late 90's).  Finance for a tech startup usually has to tie into the product / subscriptions, etc- and is thus a tech problem.  PR is to fellow geeks, etc. etc.  Then there's the fact that the bulk of the work to be done is technical- if you're going to be having allnighters for the next 3 months getting a product out- there is a _big_ difference between having a partner who is right there with you in the trenches coding across the room, and a partner who comes by every day and says ""well, uh, how's it going?""- you spend the next hour trying to explain the latest hangup etc. and then they say ""well, let me know if the schedule changes- I've got some great customers lined up..."" or whatever.<p>Sometimes that situation is unavoidable, but I guarantee it is not optimal.",comment,

Alex3917,,2105,,,1172977620,,"Yes, I'm currently working on two separate books in this application and a bunch of other things. I've found that it actually lets you have more complex ideas than you would be able to have by starting with an outline (or god forbid just freewriting). The idea is that writing should be about ideas, and words are only there to express your ideas. Because of this it doesn't make sense to start putting pen to paper until you figure out what you believe. And it's a lot easier to figure out what you believe what you can drag and drop pure ideas around instead of mucking around with text. <p>Concept maps are another tool that lets you do this, but since writing is fundamentally either flat or hierarchical in terms of how you express ideas, I think mindmaps work better. (Concept maps are essentially like thinking in 3D, which becomes a problem when you need to translate your 3D ideas into 2D writing. Also, a lot of concept maps end up with really murky causality, which kind of defeats the whole point which is to clean up your thinking.)",comment,

That is, the product being advertised potentially creates value for the user. So basically the user has to click on the link and buy the product.<p>The most profitable advertising is the type where the ad itself creates value for the user, in addition to the product being advertised. For example, music videos on MTV.<p>Unfortunately all of the social networks in existence today are monetized under the traditional model.<p>The startup I'm currently working on (kitchen table phase) is a social networking thing that actually allows users to manipulate advertising spatially in three dimensions.

What happened to all these sites? Flickr.<p>Flickr was designed around an open API from the ground up, meaning you could take your photos and embed around the web and in other applications. You could even take other people's photos and embed them around the web and in other applications. It was pretty sweet.<p>As a result they quickly dominated the photo sharing scene and were bought out by Yahoo! in record time.<p>Flickr's sustainable competitive advantage was freedom.<p>Back in June the Flickr team was having an internal debate about whether or not to allow competitors to data mine their site. Flickr's founder, Stewart Butterfield, posted a comment on his blog saying, <p>*******<p>""T]his is something that we've never had any set policy on and this thread has sparked a lot of internal debate on the team: some people felt that it was unreasonable, some people felt like it didn't matter since Flickr should win on the basis of being the best thing out there.<p>I actually had a change of heart and was convinced by Eric's position that we definitely should approve requests from direct competitors as long as they do the same. That means (a) that they need to have a full and complete API and (b) be willing to give us access.<p>The reasoning here is partly just that 'fair's fair' and more subtly, like a GPL license, it enforces user freedom down the chain. I think we'll take this approach (still discussing it internally).""<p>*******<p>This makes sense for a non-profit like Wikipedia but it was a bad idea in this case. Flickr made their money by tapping the differential in the freedom gradient, so by requiring reciprocal openness they are literally forcing the competition to steal their sustainable advantage.<p>The paradox is they'd be better off just bending over and taking it.

VCs won't trust you, and will try to reduce you to a mascot as a condition of funding. Customers will worry you're going to flake out and leave them stranded.

The core architecture of OpenID makes it possible for users or small groups of users to operate their own OpenID servers, avoiding the need to hand their personal information over to any third party to prove their (pseudonymous) identity.  If it becomes standard practice to filter OpenID requests to only allow authentication from certain large providers, then OpenID becomes no better than any other single-sign-on system.<p>Moreover, there is no advantage to filtering authentication sources.  An OpenID authentication is merely an assertion that the user is authorized to use a given universally unique identifier.  The only way that the authentication source can cheat is by permitting auths that it should deny, or vice versa.  Because users can choose the authentication source they use, there is no incentive for such cheating.  In the case of a private person running their own OpenID server, the only attack would be for that person to attack their own account, nonsensically.<p>If you're unconvinced of the security of permitting anyone to serve, consider the analogy to Jabber servers: anyone can run their own, federating into the wider XMPP network, and the network maintains security because the misbehavior of one server only affects that server's users.",comment,

If every dollar bill in everyone's wallet magically turned into two, the price of everything would double and nobody would be materially affected.  Similarly, doubling everyone's karma and causing the up arrow to give two points rather than one would have no material effect.<p>Inflation matters when you factor in time.  Inflation encourages risk.  It makes your current savings become less valuable in the future, encouraging you to try to increase your wealth to compensate.  Too much inflation encourages too much risk, and you get a bubble.<p>Money is valuable because it can be exchanged for scarce resources.  Karma is valuable because it gets you attention, which is a scarce resource.  There are two kinds of attention: visibility of articles and visibility on the leader board.  Karma is the cause of the latter, but only a byproduct of the former.  There are a fixed number of articles on the front page and a fixed number of spots on the leader board, but both become more valuable as the community grows, because more eyeballs means more attention.<p>At this point, the money analogy breaks down.  Money is both a unit of accounting and a medium of exchange.  Karma is only a unit of accounting.  It tells us how wealthy we are, but we can't exchange it for other wealth.  Attention doesn't behave like a commodity either.  If we give and receive the same amount of attention, that's not the same as simply doing nothing.<p>So, news.yc really doesn't behave anything like a conventional economy.  If any analogy can be drawn at all, I'd say that we're in a state of deflation.

We've had a small investor gives us some seed money, which could last us for about a year. We both have our personal laptops to develop it. I use a 17"" Acer, my partner has a 13"" Macbook.

Basically, the set of links which I have upmodded provides YC news with a set of potential topics that I am interested in. Naively comparing this group of links that I have upmodded with that of another user may potentially provide a non-null intersection and show possible common interests; thus, that other user may be someone I am interested in collaborating with. <p>Now that I think about it, another benefit of this is that more relevant news may be surfaced to me - if person X and person Y have a largely overlapping set of upmodded links, then perhaps the set (X-Y) may also be interesting to person Y, and vice versa. Perhaps this could be a way to deal with the perceived quality of news degrading as a site gets more popular as well, as it would allow the system to break off into smaller clusters of news items/people, where each item may be highly relevant to those who belong to the cluster.<p>Sorry to ramble on like that - I don't expect (or necessarily want) such a complicated feature to be a part of the obviously minimal YC news site...just thought I'd bring it up for discussion.<p>Edit: Used in combination with jwrecker's idea of having a more personal space, this could be a great startup idea - instead of YC News determining your set of links, it could simply be the set of links you post to your personal space :D",comment,

Get a bunch of people who have never seen your product and don't know much about it, but that are in your target demographic (shouldn't be difficult- a brother, roommate, family of the employees, someone off the street).  Sit them down in front of your product and tell them you're not going to be allowed to answer any of their questions because you're measuring the usability of the system.

Alex3917,,3470,[3471],,1173563592,,"The problem: While there are potentially many great co-founders out there, you have no one to work with. This problem has two parts:<p>A) Not knowing enough people interested in startups.<p>B) Not knowing if people would make good or bad co-founders.<p>So this is certainly a step toward solving part A. The problem is it really does nothing toward solving part B, which is by far the hardest part of the puzzle. <p>I'm sitting here reading news.YC and there are comments from dozens of smart people, some of whom would make great co-founders and some wouldn't. The issue isn't for the most part isn't the fact that I don't know they exist; I know they all exist. The issue is a lack of identity. <p>If you want to solve the co-founder problem, the solution isn't to get a large amount of people interested in starting companies in the same room. The solution comes from getting them to know each other. This comes from two things:<p>A) Identity.<p>B) Interaction.<p>Identity is 10% what we say about ourselves, and 90% what others say about us based on previous actions. To solve the identity problem you need a way to either aggregate what others say about us or else shine light on previous actions. (Previous actions being anything from college degrees to old blog posts.)<p>Interaction comes from objects of sociability. Playing games. Breaking a loaf of fresh bread. Sharing a bottle of wine over dinner. A pot of tea. Solving hard problems together. Solving difficult problems together. etc.<p>Anyway, my point is that the website doesn't solve a problem. At best it is the first 10% of the solution that enables a few people with really good judgement to solve the problem themselves.

From my limited experience, talking about your ideas to both laypeople and technical people can only help you.<p>Talking to laypeople helps you solidify and lets you practice pitching what it is that you're doing.  When you're working at a company, you don't have to explain yourself very much.  But when you say you're doing a startup, I've found that most people will demand more of an explanation.  However, most people don't have the patience in everyday settings to listen to more than 2 or 3 minutes of it.  This helps you whittle out the core of what it is that you're trying to build.  Call it a functional spec cleaning, if you want.<p>Talking about your ideas with technical people might give you insight into different areas you're not as familiar with.

See what kind of network effect you get. Pick your initial invitees wisely. If you want users, then you want them to be the so-called influencers.<p>I also have this question. I am a little reticent, though, because I'm concerned about scalability. In my case, I am writing the front end in typical database-backed fashion, but the backend is several custom C++ components.

I am now reading ""Demo Day"": http://mealticket.wordpress.com/2007/02/13/demo-day/<p>""..when you think of Facebook as being one of the most exciting companies in the Valley right now and then you realize it's being driven by a young team it makes you question a lot of assumptions. So my 'intended' career path had been law - where your pay and rank is determined purely by the number of years you have worked at the firm for. When you hit a certain age maybe you make partner and maybe you don't. But the point is that age and experience rule in that culture and not raw ability. Why do we have to assume that we can measure the ability to perform well purely by the number of years someone has worked in a particular field? Mark Zuckerberg doesn't have 10 years experience of running companies worth $1 billion but he's doing a pretty good job of it so far.<p> Why does someone who has spent 10 years analysing financial markets have a better chance of making a success out of an idea we live and breathe everyday? The attitude in the Valley is that your age is determined by the number of startups you've gone through - there are people here my age who have already started and scrapped a couple of companies.

We would have to actually put them on the payroll, which in our case would mean actually having a payroll. <p>Now, that is probably a bit alarmist but its the kind of thing that might scare off investors in the future.

It's their bread and butter. They can do it under the law, or at least their lawyers are convinced they can, because of a legal concept known as Common Carrier (Some people in the audience will notice I'm simplifying.

It provides rules, which say you need to take things down when you're asked, but you're otherwise not culpable- As long as you take it down when asked, you're OK.<p> Now, with Youtube, before Google invested anything in it,  Google sees a lawsuit coming which could change that.. They KNOW that youtube is likely to be sued, and don't want to have the judge define the laws in a way which screws them over.. They know this lawsuit is coming one way or another, and that Youtube is poor, so their legal defense is likely to..well..suck.<p>Google realizes that if they buy Youtube, they can use their considerable legal muscle and financial capital to DEFEND youtube, and to make sure that they law isn't redefined in a way that screws them.. <p>Since the US system works by a process of Common Law, the precedent is binding. That means that this case will be VERY influential in dertermining any other cases. And it's THOSE that is worried about.<p>THAT's why Google bought Youtube. They want this Lawsuit very badly.<p>Well, As an aside- There's also the line of reasoning that Sequoia Capital was heavily pushing Google for the acqusition.. YouTube was smart/lucky enough to convince Sequoia to invest, which gives Google a good inventive to do the buyout.. That said, I think this was an ancillary factor, not a primary one.

For entrepreneurs with a previous failure it was 20%, and for entrepreneurs with a previous success it was 33%.<p>I suspect that the success rate is somewhat higher for bootstrapped tech startups, because you're given the option of failing and trying again with the same company, different idea.

The first mountain was computation (e.g., microprocessors), then usability, then networking/communications. What's next? I believe a big breakthrough in established fields like AI, VR, etc. are low probability using existing computational models, the weak proof being that a lot of very bright people have been working on these hard problems for a very long time and advances appear to be small and incremental.

nostrademons,,4244,"[4247, 4246]",,1173907581,,"Reading and keeping up with the news is kinda odd.  99% of what you read is absolutely useless.  It will never make a difference in what you do, and you'll probably never use it.  However, that remaining 1% can save you *huge* amounts of time or open up massive opportunities.<p>Just a couple examples where procrastination has changed my life.<p>When I was 16, my family went shopping at the Tanger 2 supermall in Riverhead NY.  I hate shopping.  So, I did what I normally do: I found a bookstore, grabbed an interesting book, curled up on the floor, and read half of it by the time my parents got back.  On that particular occasion, the book was ""Learn Java 1.0.2 in 7 days"" or some other tripe like that, the year was 1997, and the Java wave was just taking off.  One book led to a second and third, and then a whole shelf full, and eventually an internship at MITRE corporation.<p>While on the job, I was asked to learn Perl.  A couple years later, immediately after high school graduation, my math teacher's wife was starting a company and had an immediate need for some Perl programming.  In the year I spent at that company, I got to experience a dot-com run exclusively by teenagers, 3 different business plans, all the tribulations of a startup, and eventually an ugly VC takeover.<p>While slacking off at that company because I had no work to do, I found Fanfiction.net and the Harry Potter fandom.  I read a whole bunch of fics, then my workload picked up again and I promply forgot about it.  I went back to it during college, and ended up joining FictionAlley.org, which was just starting at the time.  Over the 4 years that I volunteered for FA, I saw it grow from 2,000 registered users to 100,000 registered users, from one machine to three, had my first experience managing teams of software developers and got to take my first major project from conception to completion.<p>Separate thread - at an internship after my freshman year, I was goofing off at work and reading Ward's Wiki.  I ended up getting pretty involved in housekeeping there after the internship ended, and struck up a few friendships.  One of them led *directly* to the startup I'm currently employed at, via a couple of internships.<p>Now that I'm co-founding a startup of my own, I'm finding that all the different internships and threads and so on pull together.  I know what to expect in terms of growing a community.  I've had experience with 2-3 different technology stacks (and found they all suck ;-), but at least that led me to one I'm reasonably happy with).  I know all about scaling concerns and breaking an app out over multiple boxes.  I've got some experience in judging whether a business model will fly or not.  (I think our business model sucks, BTW, and really doubt it'll get us off the ground, but we've gotta start somewhere.)<p>All of this came, in some way or another, from procrastination.<p>Incidentally, running a startup seems much the same way.  The vast majority of stuff you do is worthless, but the 1% that pays off really pays off big.  Unfortunately, you have no way of knowing what that 1% is until you try it.  People talk about how Bill Gates got lucky with the IBM deal - the thing is, Microsoft had a zillion balls in the air at the time, and if they hadn't gotten lucky with IBM they might very well have gotten lucky elsewhere.",comment,

There it's like 200$ total.  For a start-up, you normally don't need a whole lot of ""lawyer juice"" in the equation.  The forms are very simple.  You basically fill out the articles of incorporation document, then fill out a listing of officers/board members (initial listing of officers), which can be changed later.  You also need to have a resident agent, which doesn't need to be a physical place, so long as lawsuit stuff can get there.  Many places offer resident agencies as a service for as little as 99$.  The deputy just needs to be able to deliver you some lawsuit/whatever.  You send it all off to the secretary of state in whatever state you wish to incorporate, then in a few weeks later you get a copy of the forms back plus a certificate signed by the secretary of state saying that you're incorporated under that state.  Normally all states have a website where you can look up information about a particular corporation.  Every year you have to pay a few hundred bucks or so to rewnew the initial listing of officers.  It gets a little more complex if you have investors and the company is initially shared between several people/other companies, but overall, its really that simple.  <p> Delaware might charge more because of the simple fact that so many companies incorporate there.

Good early feedback, much appreciated. <p>I'm building CrowdVine because I want to see social networks treated as first class social media applications, joining blogs, wikis, and pod/video-casts. <p>In response to the nothing to do but read blogs comment, in a niche social network the people are the content. Connecting to them and finding ways to build an identity within the community are the main activities. If you're applying social networks in way that ties in with people's identity then you can have a lot of socializing without a lot of features. If you're (mis)applying a social network to a topic that has nothing to do with people's identity then you're going to have to build in a lot of other activities.<p>I think it's a big boon that Ning decided to focus just for the fact that it helps define the market. They obviously have an amazing team. It'll be interesting to see if they stay with the social-networks-for-everyone market given that they're already doing deals for bigger networks (for CBS), neither of their founders actually uses the software to run a social network, and that they're already 27 people big and 9 million in the hole.",comment,

Even if Apollo catches on like nothing since C, it wouldn't kill Firefox; the user still needs a browser.<p>Yes, FF supports rich application development in XUL, and yes, Apollo might compete with that somewhat, but it doesn't really matter.  XUL is there not as a feature but as a tool: the FF UI is built with XUL.  That it is useful for others is really just a detail.  In FF3, there will be more emphasis and support given to XUL apps, but still, it's there for the browser.<p>Also, the degree of competitions between FF and Apollo is, I think, overestimated.  Apollo is basically just another RAD toolkit.  XUL apps aren't desktop apps, they run directly in the browser just like Ajax apps.  That gives them an entirely different use case than Apollo.

It is by far one of my favorite web tools, and I think one of the most useful things about it is the way that it encourages a sort of conversation between its users (ie, someone can send a bookmrak to me, which of itself, begins a sort of dialogue between us, or can write a description in the notes taht I know is intended for me). What I find disappointing sometimes is that when this happens there is no way for me respond to them directly about the link (you can send messages to another user, but then you lose a lot of the context). The most obvious answer would be to allow me to comment on other users' bookmarks or ""send"" them a message back about the bookmark they sent me. The explanation I keep getting when I say this is that they didn't want to distract users or muddy the purpose of the app by turning it into another blogging tool. Ultimately, I think they made the right choice not to add this feature. It keeps it clean and useful while still allowing for self expression within the core of the application. I would probably like Digg a lot more if I weren't so damned distracted by all of the threaded comments that follow each post, most of which are completely useless.",comment,

You hear that startups end up moving away from there initial ideas so often that bar for being sure that you ""know"" what you're going to need is very high. <p>I also think he overstates the difficulties of abstracting out extensible pieces as you go. His point about your # of customers being proportional to the difficulty of refactoring is well taken, but for an early startup this probably does not mean as much as he suggests. On the web you can do a great deal that is transparent to your customers. The risk of this approach might lie more in not having to discipline to take the time to refactor as you go as opposed to not having the technical ability. 37 Signals seems to have had certain project go very well for them by pushing down abstractions as they went (granting however, that everyone can't count on a gang of open source hackers coming in and both contributing to and evangelizing your product's infrastructure - though maybe this isn't a bad goal?).",comment,

reitzensteinm,,5331,,,1174466593,,"Actually, it can work on the same principle as PPC, except the $/click takes time to work out (you have to send traffic to the site to determine how much revenue it gets you). Analagous to your example is Amazon biding $0.00001 per click - they would simply be outbid by sites willing to pay more for the keywords. The only difference is that with PPC there's a minimum - I think it's 5 cents, though it might have increased to 10 - but you can define an action as an extremely infrequent event. But that difference only comes into play when you've got no competition, and if you've got no competition for a keyword, it's extremely unlikely that it's going to be a lucrative one.<p>The key point is that Google figures out how much it makes by sending people to a site, and ranks the sites based on that metric. So just like Adwords, there's no getting around the fact that paying Google more (by bidding higher, or on more frequent events) will get you better placement, and therefore more traffic.",comment,

python_kiss,,5605,,,1174535789,,"Dan, thank you for sharing that awesome list. Joel's recommended books are great; in fact, back when I was developing a micro ISV, I used to turn to Joel's website for advice. That is where I discovered Paul Graham's ""Hackers and Painters"". Since then, I have shifted my allegiance to a new mentor :) I think the book brought three major changes in how I think:<p>1. Think big: Since I was developing a micro ISV, I had never really considered scaling the business to millions of customers (aka users). ""Hackers and Painters"" entered my life just a few weeks before I was about to launch my product; and I realized I had to develop something that can scale. I took a leap of faith and decided to instead pursue web startups; the opportunities for growth were many times in magnitude.<p>2. There are others like me: Toronto, Canada is not exactly a Silicon Valley. So uptil then, I didn't know there were so many other young entrepreneurs pursuing the same goals as me. Eventhough I wasn't acquainted with other hackers, I could at least gain a sense of security that I am not alone.<p>3. The Art of the Start: The single most valuable lesson I learned from Paul's book was the governing dynamics of web startups. Before reading it, there was not much inspiration or reason to think big because even if I did venture into online startups, I wouldn't know what to do.<p> While I have read some excellent books, I can credit Paul's work for watering the first seeds.",comment,

I still go back to H&P every few months, when I get worried about such things.<p>Just yesterday I started reading ""Founders at Work"", and from what I've gotten through, it's going to be great.

capoeirista,,5793,,,1174598490,,"This is an interesting question, and as a girl geek who is applying to y combinator and has worked for many startups, I can mention a few things. <p>1) Startup culture appears to be a boys' club.  <p>a) Have you ever noticed that when you hire the first woman in any company, the dynamic changes? There's resistance to that change, whether it's for better or worse. (pun intended) There's a big sign on your clubhouse that says [GIRLZ KEEP OUT!] Sometimes it's very subtle. Sometimes overt. How many of you actually had women on the short list of people you were choosing to partner with? Some geeky guys still have a hard time talking with girls. It may be an issue with whom you're comfortable sharing your great idea. From what I've read in these posts, you have some assumptions that you're making about girls. Truth is, when you get to a certain level of skill or creativity, assumptions need to fly out the window - for both men and women. <p> b) With that being said, I love it when work consumes me with a passion and takes all of my time to the exclusion of all else. I have mad skills in a bunch of different areas and startups seem to want me. . . but they don't think of me as a co-founder. I code, design, do market research, marketing strategy, media buys, infrastructure, pitches. . .  basically I've worked for many startups doing everything necessary to get started. Still thought of as an accessory - never fully included. My solution to this has been to position myself differently - and I can do that now. I need to market my skills differently from the way guys do. This has been successful. <p>2) We're not as sensitive to hierarchies and heirarchies' flip side, competition, as guys are. <p>a) We often just want to get it done. We don't care as much if it strokes our ego or your ego. It needs to be done. If, every time we have a conversation, it becomes a zero sum game of who wins the dominance, it's stupid. <p>If there's a list of things that need to get done on the table, and some tasks are seen as too onerous for guys' job descriptions (egos), we wind up doing it because it needs to get done. Because we did it, somehow our status falls. We wind up getting stuck with _all_ the crappy jobs, and it winds up sucking for us as our status continually sinks. <p>b) We assess ourselves and our skills differently. Here's an illustrative example. A female engineer once told me why she gave up working in industry. She was the only woman working with a team of guys. The team lead would throw out a task for discussion on the table. Everyone but she would say they could do it easily. She would say that no, this has these challenges and would take much longer. One of the guys who said that it was easy would get the project and then go to her for help doing the problematic tasks. Who got promoted? The guy. Who was doing all the hard work? She was. Female examiners at the patent office tell the same story. There are a lot of women engineers who leave industry because they can assess themselves and the problems accurately and this isn't valued. Managers want their problems solved. They value gung-ho over truth.<p>c) This is often linguistic. Men and women use different syntax to express the same thoughts. I need to remap what makes sense to me onto another linguistic pattern and that seems to be a waste of energy. In fact, this has a lot of benefit because it makes us better communicators all around. It's a learning curve - and it's often hard to recognize that it's there or needed. (I was a linguistics geek in college, where I found out that 85% of all conversational interruptions occur men on women, so it's a challenge for us to get a complete paragraph size thought into a conversation - much less complete a sentence without being completely stepped on.) <p>But even in the more egalitarian parts of the States, there are different linguistic patterns for men and women. If you go to the South, it's much more amplified. If a woman makes a statement with the same intonation and wording as a guy, the conversation just stops for a hot minute while everyone in the room processes it. In places like Alabama, I need to preprocess so that the communication is seamless and the conversational stoppages don't occur - and this often means using what would be considered subservient speech, like ending a statement with a questionmark. Up north, if I'm in a roomful of guys, or even just talking with one, the preprocessing still needs to happen. <p>        d) It may be that because we're not as sensitive to hierarchies and have different sensibilities about status, money means something fundamentally different to us. <p>        e) When I was in college, I really wanted to go into physics, and I was good at it. I spent a summer working for NASA and saw how cutthroat the competition was among the physics geeks and didn't like it. Several years later, I was the webmaster for a hearing research center at a big university. It was a collection of twenty or so labs. I noticed that there were a lot of female scientists, that there was a lot of collaboration between scientists in this particular center and also around the world. I decided to find out what was so different and spent about a year asking people how it came about. <p>The story is interesting. It wasn't by accident. It turns out that at MIT thirty years ago, there was a hearing research professor who got all of his grad students together and told them that their careers didn't have to be all sniping and competitive - that they could do something different and agree to cooperate. These grad students are now the heads of their own departments. They teach their undergrad and grad students what behavior is acceptable and are growing a culture of deep respect and cooperation. It has a lot of benefits for hearing research as a whole. Work isn't hidden from each other and duplicated - meaning money and time isn't wasted - so it's much better for the hearing research discipline. There isn't the attitude of hoarding ideas for credit. Everyone's resumé has long lists of collaborations. Mostly, everyone's really happy and nice. Apparently, vision research is the exact polar opposite. <p>I know that in a free market society, competition is seen as creating efficiency, but in a lot of ways, it's very wasteful because of hoarding of ideas and duplication of effort. For people who don't have access to resources, cooperation results in significantly greater value. There isn't nearly as much money available for hearing research, but these researchers are incredibly efficient because they eliminated the competition from the discipline. They're still evaluated. They still have to do their work and be very good at it. It's just that the element of fear is gone. <p>Alpha males and alpha females see competition differently. How many alpha males can be in a company at any one time? Those who aren't the tiny percent of you who are alpha males feel fear when there's excessive competition. Do you want to work in a fearful environment?<p>    3) If we're single and cute, the dominant chimp will hit on us unless he has a well developed sense of morals. I've been around and around with this one with other women about what to do in response to this and have seen a lot of different strategies to handle it. Some women just shut down their levels of expression and passion for their work. (sucky solution) I know one woman who pretended she was a lesbian. (sucky solution, but one of the most successful - she still retained respect) This comes up a lot at female executive dinners. It's tiresome because when the dominant chimp's ego's bruised there's _always_ retaliation of some form. <p>4) It may be that y combinator and the VC game doesn't get us where we want to be. <p>a) If the majority of all small businesses in the States are being started by women, and if we're especially good at communication and customer service, which you'd think would be great for Web 2.0, then what is it about the whole VC game that doesn't get us there? How are we starting our businesses without you? When we're starting businesses, what's the structure like? What kinds of businesses are they? <p>b) I know that usually VCs or angels don't even look at people until they've spent $50k of their own money. Women have a harder time coming up with funds like that. We still don't have wage parity. We're taking care of our parents or our sister's kids. It's harder for us to get out of family obligations. In the family, daughters are still thought of differently. While I was still an undergrad, I was a founder in a startup. I had to leave to take care of my sick mother. When I asked her if I were a guy, would she have asked me to give up my business, she replied, ""no."" without any hesitation. We're still expected to do the bulk of non-market labor in this culture. If we say no, there are repercussions. Being a good girl is always for someone else's convenience. <p>c) It may be a timing thing. Women may have different goals immediately after college. It would be interesting to check to see how old the women are who are starting businesses in this country. I'd want to check the distribution graph - don't just look at the mean or median ages of when they're starting businesses - I bet there are several humps on it - each would tell a different story about that group's lives. By excluding women who are above a certain age, you're cutting out a lot of experience and wisdom. One of the coolest businesses was started by Mary Kay. However cheezy her pink Caddies are, she had a lot of insight into how women ran their lives and built her cosmetics distribution model on those insights.<p>d) I'm willing to bet that women are starting businesses with less, are entering businesses with lower barriers to entry in general, and that the geeky women aren't starting businesses or aren't going your route to do it. If you look at the percentage of female college grads in engineering and the sciences, it's a much higher percentage than who are applying to y combinator. How are their opportunities and thoughts different? Perhaps you should ask them. You're missing a lot of talent by not addressing it. Are there qualities that you are rewarding that talented women find reprehensible or icky?<p>By definition, you're looking for special people. The next Teslas are going to be odd no matter where they're from or what their gender is. What would have happened to Tesla if there had been no viciousness of Edison's smear campaigns? Clearly the world lost out. (I have a thing for Tesla, and in an ideal world, Firefly would still be on the air.) <p>If the next Tesla is currently wearing a burka in Afghanistan, she, and the world, are out of luck. If she's in school just down the river, or has just sent her kids off to college, you may be able to do something about it if you want to.",comment,

Of course not, and this argument can be continued. Therefore the value one can state is surely one that gives a rough sense of the amount of money that one would take for the company, a fuzzy value. Of ocurse most people would be willing to take a lesser amount, but when they state the lesser amount, they'd probably take even then a smaller sum again.<p>And of course if an investor would be willing to invest 19 million than he would probably be willing to invest 20 million as well... after having established the rough amount of money one would take the outcome seems to depend on negotiation skills.

Here's another pass:<p>I completely get the fact that projects are not a bad thing.  Most of the best businesses actually started out as projects.<p>It makes total sense for me that startups should pursue building something people want (and make that the focus).  However, a subset of these are projects that seek to build something people want AND that they will pay for.  I'd further argue that within this particular subset of ideas, the optimal choice might be to build something people will pay for from the get go.  In these cases, it would be sub-optimal to simply strive to build something people want.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that in some situations, trying to find the problem that people want solved AND will pay for ends up putting the startup on the right idea wheresa if they simply tried to build something people want, they may wind up in the wrong place.<p>Not all software is best served by creating something that will be subsidized by another activity (like advertising).

Alex3917,,6075,[6081],,1174747369,,"Sociologically, twitter is very different from other communication forms. AIM and Skype are designed for communicating thoughts and ideas. Twitter, however, is designed for telecocooning. Telecocooning is traditionally defined as sending little ""presence pokes"" to people. For example, just saying hi or sending someone a picture of a heart or a smiley face. The point of these messages isn't the ideas they contain, but rather the message itself. That is, just getting any message from someone shows that the other person is thinking about them and cares about them.<p>Traditionally people telecocoon with their two or three closest friends. However, Twitter lowers the telecocooning barrier so you can telecocoon with many more friends for the same effort. People tend to just send messages like ""ahh homework sucks"" or ""heh stuck at the library."" You aren't really communicating anything intelligent, but you are building a feeling of group solidarity by letting people around you know what's up. It also helps people to find where their friends are if they want to meet up.",comment,

Alex3917,,6140,"[6160, 6473]",,1174825975,,"Great speech. My only comment is on the idea that we will look back on professionals as being like serfs. As Paul mentioned earlier, what is driving people into the service of others is a combination of social status, risk avoidance, and the need for ""structure.""<p>I don't think risk avoidance and need for structure will ever change. The real question is whether our conceptions of social status will change. So I've been writing a lot recently about how organizations and institutions exploit people's need for social status in order to secure cheap labor and make money. <p>The most obvious example is how WoW literally allows you to ""level up."" Even though objectively you are just spending 12 hours a day clicking on pictures of digital rats on a computer screen, qualitatively it's designed to make you feel like a hero. Everyone wants to be a hero in real life, but most people are just too lazy or untalented or risk adverse. It's not fair, but that's the way it is. Organizations have figured out how to tap into people's need to ""be the hero"" while extracting cheap labor (or purchases) from them. <p>A good example is when I was learning to play the trumpet. Learning to play a musical instrument is a very slow and continuous process. If my trumpet teacher were to have said, ""ok, today you are level one trumpet. ok, now you're level two trumpet. etc."" I think most people could figure out it's a scam. Improving at trumpet is a continuous function, not something that happens in levels.<p>The thing is, when people say, ""ok, you're level one at education, you're level three at business."" then no one realizes they are being exploited. In general, reality is very continuous. Whenever someone tries to represent a phenomena as something you can ""level up"" in, chances are they are trying to fuck you, take your money, or both. <p>Until people realize this is happening, professionalism will never go away. Instead people are obsessed with ""climbing the ladder."" Thing is, climbing the ladder benefits the people at the top, not the bottom. The average person doesn't even realize this.<p>I think in order for this mentality to end, two things are needed:<p>1) People currently view social status as a function of what people with money and power think of you. People need to instead view social status a function of your ability to MSPW.<p>2) We need new forms of social signaling that take this into account. Currently people identify themselves through college credentials, brand name clothes, etc. I think social signaling DOES have an important economic role to play, however, we need new forms of social signaling based around MSPW.",comment,

However, when you're business only costs 10,000 to start you can harness the power of informal systems and volunteers and crowd wisdom, etc. The perfect example of this would be Wikipedia.

I'm perhaps a bit unrepresentative since my normal job is also at a (later-stage, profitable) startup, but I found my day job is far more stressful than the startup.<p>When you work for someone else, there are a large number of factors that you cannot control.  You can't pick your technologies: you generally have to go along with what the rest of the team is already using.  You can't pick your company culture: it's already been established.  You can't pick your market (okay, you can't really either with your own startup).  You're stuck with the existing codebase.<p>All this is fine if you also pick up your employer's values and expectations.  But I don't know any startup founder that's like this.  Usually, if you're interested in starting a company, it's because you have some internal standards for the quality that you'd like your code to live up to and the ease with which users can use it.  So if you're working for someone else, you can easily get stuck with your own standards and your employer's tools, and the two may not match.<p>This is really, really stressful.<p>When I'm working on my startup, at least I know that any problems I'm having are <i>my</i> fault.

If I find that a framework is becoming more of a hassle than a help, I can rip it out and replace it with my own code without my boss vetoing it.<p>There's a whole other level of stress that comes from mixing both day job and startup.  Right now, the most stressful thing in my life is wondering whether I should quit the day job to work full time on the startup.  It's stressful because there is pitiably little information and yet it's an incredibly important decision.  I won't know whether the reduced time available has caused me to miss my market opportunity until I've actually missed the market opportunity, at which point it's too late.  Similarly, I won't know whether the added time pressure has made me mortgage the startup's codebase until it becomes impossible to work with, at which point it's generally too late to fix.",comment,

BitGeek,,6237,"[6252, 6268]",,1174873777,,"I think YCombinator is attempting great things and has a great strategy.  However, after StartupSchool I'm mulling over my intention to build my startup without getting any funding.  Yet, what I saw yesterday was mostly based on the assumption that a startup has to go thru rounds of funding.<p>A bit of background:  I'm not young, right out of college. I've been working for startups for about 18 years with a couple periodic stints at major tech companies. In all the startups I've worked for, the two leading causes of startup death are 1) Founder friction.  2) Stupid VC tricks.<p>Founder friction is a risk that I'm sure everyone understands.  But the risk of taking money from a VC is one that I think is under appreciated.   Generally these risks manifest themselves in the form of the VC meddling in the company to the theoretical benefit of the VC, and the companies detriment.   Speaking of instances I have intimate knowledge of, in one case the investment was contingent on 1/3 of it being spent on hardware and software from two companies that the VC had ties to-- overpriced hardware when commodity PCs would have done, and very expensive software that caused us to hire consultants (from the company that sold the software of course) to try and make it work, and ultimately forced us to revert to the original plan and build it ourselves.  Significantly delaying our ability to scale up the product.  <p>In another case the VC required that we hire a new CEO, and manuvered us into hiring a friend of the Partners who was non-technical and was fond of changing company direction quarterly whether we needed it or not, to follow the latest business fad... no matter how irrelevant it was to our industry.  (EG: one quarter it was ""Push"" and we were a company that made video game technology... nothing to do with ""Push"" but we had to have a ""push story"" and issue press releases.)<p>And of course, you can find lots of other examples of similar things happening at other companies. <p>I don't want to paint with too broad of a brush.  I recognize that my experience is limited to the half dozen startups I've worked for, and the dozen or so VC partners and associates I've known over the years. <p>But I have a strong impression that these are not people who understand technology, or the technology business well enough to give good advice.   Further, they have shown a propensity to force companies to go in a direction that helps their other investments, but may be detrimental to the company. <p>And, more importantly, is investment really necessary?  <p>In this day and age, you can get servers provisioned easily-- no need to commit to hardware purchases and long term datacenter leases.  The tools are high level and easy to use and there's a lot of open source to leverage so that you can focus on the added value part of your product.   Leverage has increased dramatically.  <p>Furthermore, companies are now starting to go without investment, such as MyBlogLog which was acquired only a few months after launch without doing a VC round. <p>Thus I reach the conclusion that the course for me to take is to not seek investment at all. <p>This may not be possible for someone who is recently out of college.  (And thus the funding from YC is not the kind of investment I'm talking about here-- the presusre to use the money to get three months of solid focus on the product is really positive ""interference"" especially when backed by the rapid feedback, networking, and weekly seminars.) <p>But if you start to get some traction with your product, and you're not building something that inherently requires massive investment... probably small angel rounds are the way to go until you can be acquired or reach profitability.<p>And while being acquired may always be wise-- reaching profitability is a milestone that I think truely marks success.  Nobody can ever take that away from you once you've done it-- its victory.<p>Startupschool was great-- was good inspiration, and much of what was said checked well with my thoughts giving me a boost in confidence that I'm on the right track. <p>I love lists like ""5 dos  and 5 don'ts"" or the X things that cause startups to fail, or Pauls 16 reasons... love to check those off and go ""Yep, Yep, Yep""... and there were a couple that I need to work on. <p>Hopefully this little rant is not offending anybody... in summary, I'd say winning means making a viable business.

Alex3917,,6242,,,1174875409,,"When investing in early stage companies, you put in less money and the upside is much greater. If this were the full picture then obviously early stage ventures would be a better deal. Of course, many more early stage companies go under than late stage companies. This extra risk is supposed to balance out the greater reward. But does it?<p>To borrow Kedrosky's terminology,  VC investing is really a combination of two separate skills: picking and poking. Picking is choosing which startups to invest in, and poking is helping the startup along to further its chances of success. <p>The vast majority of people investing in early stage ventures are friends, family, and fools. Because these people aren't very good at either picking or poking, their risk level is very high. This in turn drives up the cost of capital. <p>You can reduce your risk by becoming better at picking. You can also reduce your risk by becoming better at poking. And if you can become better at both, you can reduce your risk a huge amount. Because there are so few investors who are good at both, these people are barely even taken into account when determining the cost of capital. Which is why if you are good at both, it's an arbitrage opportunity for the investor.<p>For late stage ventures, there is much more money on the table which means much less amateur investment. Because you don't have as many dumb people pumping up the cost of capital, there isn't really any arbitrage opportunity. <p>Incidentally, PG has reduced his risk even further by creating news.YC so he can get to know the founders a little bit before investing. Theoretically, if a founder knows that PG has less risk because of this, the founder should be able to use this as leverage to get a better valuation. However, this doesn't work in reality because the shortage of PGs creates a market inefficiency (in favor of PG). However, I suspect that anyone who can successfully clone him will have a good arbitrage opportunity.",comment,

nostrademons,,6246,,,1174875997,,"This is a hard question.  I considered dropping out multiple times in college, but ended up sticking it out and getting my degree.  I'm still not sure if it was the right choice, but it seems to be working out so far.  Anyways, I have no answers, but I have some observations.<p>One of my main fears in college was that I would graduate, take a soul-crushing job, and then lose all desire to start a startup.  This hasn't happened.  I still want a successful startup just as much as I did in college, or maybe even more.  You're not going to stop wanting what you've always wanted just because you have a degree, a job, money, and options.<p>OTOH, having a job and an income fucks with your perceptions a little.  I was lucky (smart?) and didn't change my spending habits; over the past year and a half that I've been working, I banked close to 90% of my take-home pay.  Even though I'm financially much more secure than I was coming out of college, it feels much more precarious - I've gotten used to having a certain amount of money coming in each month.  Quitting my day job wouldn't be an issue if I didn't have a day job.<p>Don't underestimate the experience you'll learn on the job.  I feel like I've benefited significantly from working in somebody else's startup for a year and a half before trying my own.  It also creates a sense of momentum and gets your brain in gear; you'll need all the focus you can have when starting your startup.  <p>Don't overestimate the book learning you'll get in college.  Honestly, I don't think a single thing I learned in the classroom has helped me with my startup.  <p>OTOH, a lot of college learning occurs <i>outside</i> the classroom.  My impossible quest to complete a computer science major in one semester while the department would not let me declare one turned out to be <i>exactly</i> what startup life is all about.  There will be many moments when you have to work like hell for what feels like zero payoff.  It's a good experience to really fuck up and then recover from it, because you do that a lot with startups.  If you skip the recovery part in college, how do you know you'll be able to do it with your startup?<p>Also, I met my cofounders in college.  Had I left after freshman year, I would never have known them.  Had I left later, I probably wouldn't have kept in touch.<p>Probably the biggest factor in my decision not to leave is that I didn't have a clear idea what I would do instead.  That's probably the biggest determinant: if you know <i>exactly</i> what you'll be working on instead (like Michael Dell, Bill Gates, or Mark Zuckerberg) do that instead.  If you don't, stay in school, because you'll probably end up doing nothing instead, and nothing isn't a particularly good teacher.",comment,

I still feel a bit reckless because I don't have <i>the</i> idea, just a lot of smaller potential ones, but the absolute worst thing that can happen is that I graduate one year later.<p>Lots of people told me that I should be careful that I don't throw away my degrees, but I can only see that happening in two ways: (a) I am wildly successful, in which case the degrees won't matter; or (b) I think that I'm on the verge of significant success right when the time comes to go back to uni.

The local and state government levels of regulation are very high, and thus time spent dealing with the burocrats is much higher.  All these are distractions you don't need.<p>6. The availability of good startup quality employees is lower in the Bay Area.  Because startups per capita is much higher there, there are more startups competing for the same employees. <p>5. Office rent is expensive, Gas is expensive, Taxes are high, everything you could want to buy costs more.    Your burn rate is going to be much higher.<p>4. You can't find a place to live.  Your employees can't either.  Both you and your employees need more money to cover basic cost of living... your burn rate is much higher. <p>3. Being in the bay area means being on the VC treadmill.  This is the opposite of working for yourself, you are working for the VCs, and unless you triple their money in three years, you get nothing.  This forces bad decisions and much less leverage.<p>2. Long frustrating commutes reduce employee productivity and morale. They also reduce the length of the workday.<p>1. The state taxes capital gains like income!

As you get closer to larger companies, people on the road tend to be more rude.  I'm thinking of the San Jose/Milpitas area.  I think most of those workers are unhappy to be treading off to their anonymous jobs :)<p>10.  Disagree.  If you live on the 101, I could see how you would feel that way, but try to drive around los gatos or saratoga and say that.  No urban sprawl.  Plus, 'quality of life' is such a nebulous term....for me, quality of life is improved just by the energy of this place and the diverse types of people it attracts.<p>9.  I don't know anyone on prozac, and I'm not sure what that has to do with population density...<p>Speaking of population density/sprawl, I met this nice lady very recently who had just relocated from Paris.  Having been lucky enough to visit there myself, I had to tell her how beautiful I thought her city was.  She said that she was happy to leave, as the bay area was a ""lot greener"" (her words) and better for children.<p>8.  You point should show anyone why the bay area is a great place.  Where else would you know 70 founders??  And getting an edge on your competition doesn't necessarily involve secrecy....<p>7.  Totally agree about having to find a home, etc.  But the regulations are pretty minor from a biz standpoint relative to the benefits of doing business here.  <p>6.  Would you rather be a big fish in a small pond?  If your startup has potential, you should not only be able to compete with other startups to hire, you will be able to pick from among the best people in the world.<p>5.  Second order problems.  Instead of looking at expenses, you should be looking at the place that allows your startup to have the most room to grow.  If your primary concern is the cost of living, move to Thailand.  Gorgeous beaches, your dollar goes incredibly far, and oh, the closest thing to a technology company there is the guy selling electronic keychains on the street...<p>4.  I've been in the valley since 2000 - it's much easier to find a place here now than it was back then.  And salaries aren't that much higher here than they are in other tech centers in the USA or even Canada.<p>3.  Disagree.  Since when is having more options a negative thing?  If you don't need VC  money, don't spend your time chasing it.  But if you do, you'll  have a much better chance getting it here. <p>Face it - if you need VC money, the treadmill exists regardless of which city your business is situated in - you'll just have an easier time getting on the treadmill if you're in the bay area.<p>2.  Can't disagree with that...commutes certainly suck, and they're longer here than most places.<p>1.  Agreed...which is why holding onto a stock for  1yr is good, but that's a different conversation...<p>",comment,

BrandonM,,6580,,,1174987192,,"I would say that the answer to your last question should be a resounding ""yes"".  The whole point of the ""beta"" label is to alert potential users that the product is not completely stable, but is in some usable state.  The problem is not so much that the service was not 100% reliable, but that the NYT readers expected it to be and relied critically upon it.<p>As most Linux and 'BSD users have come to learn, ""beta"" means just that: not ready for critical use.  The user gains some privileges, like being able to use ""bleeding-edge"" software or to get a valuable service for free, and in return they sacrifice the stability and reliability that comes with time-tested software; all that as they actually are an integral piece to testing that software. Without such a beta stage, the whole rapid development movement would fail as projects get mired in extensive internal testing stages.<p>Your GMail comment especially strikes me, as I hadn't considered that before.  Perhaps they grew much faster than anticipated and are still working on stability issues, and the ""losing my emails"" scenario may not be far off the mark.  By attaching the ""beta"" label to their service, they can probably avoid any liability that may arise if such an event did occur.",comment,

BrandonM,,6583,,,1174988226,,"""Hold some features back in your first release.<p>Release them next week or next month. This makes your customers think that you are actively developing your product and that there is momentum behind your product.""<p>This statement really irks me, not just as a programmer, but as a consumer.  I initially thought the article might be a little joke, but since the other tips were more reasonable, I have to assume that it is serious.  I can understand holding back features in your initial release, but there are much better reasons than those that were cited.  To purposely trick your potential users seems to me to be a bad business model, and smells of the corporate mindset of money and growth over all else. I think it is important to remember that the whole point of developing a product is to fulfill a need (or want) of the customer, and I think that as the average consumer gets more intelligent, these types of tactics will be more transparent and will do more harm than good to the startup.<p>As for better reasons for holding back features:<p>1. In any interesting piece of software, I would imagine that there are potentially hundreds of features which could be added.  The difficult problem is deciding when to be (temporarily) content with what you have and release.  Thus, some desired features must be left out in order to avoid the perfectionist mindset, where nothing ever gets released.<p>2. A mostly-implemented feature may work correctly most of the time, but fail mysteriously at other times. Even with a beta release, it's probably best to avoid these types of features which only serve to make your product less reliable.<p>3. A feature may be fully-implemented, but there may be no clear way to integrate it into the UI.  In this case, it would probably be best to hold off and drop hints of the feature to beta testers, who could give their feedback on how best to integrate it.  After all, the feature is meant for the users to actually use, isn't it?<p>4. A feature may add computational complexity to the software which may be overly taxing on the initial hardware that a startup company is using. Improve the hardware before adding the feature, or better yet, improve the code which implements the feature.<p> Am I being overly idealistic?  Am I alone in thinking that the proposed ""marketing trick"" is a bad idea?",comment,

The essay cleared up things things that the video obscured (couldn't see the visuals), like the ""not-so-smart"" / ""enterprise software"" connection (I was thinking he just meant the competition was dumb so you'd have the one-eyed man / land of the blind advantage).  <p>The big surprise is that YC hasn't seen an order of magnitude increase in applicants from their first round.  You'd think this impossible: Paul announced the first YC program only about a week before its deadline and they got something like 250 applications.  Now they are all over the tech news and they still haven't cracked 1000?  Maybe PG's new speaking approach (memorize, practice, use visuals) is an effort to get more people fired up?  <p>Paul, regarding this new speaking style: you <i>could</i> make yourself into a Steve Jobs dynamo of a speaker, but I think you shouldn't.  Your usual wordsmith style is probably better for attracting nerds.      <p>Question: Paul, it sounds like you've mostly swung in the direction of encouraging people to look at their own lives for problems to solve.  Whereas in ""Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas"" you were saying the opposite, like in the two paragraphs starting with ""Reading the Wall Street Journal for a week should give anyone ideas... ""  Trevor says something similar in the footnotes.  But it looks like YC has been placing all its bets on the first sort of ideas.  There's a good reason: all the huge software successes come from the ""build it for you and your friends"" model because those are the problems you fully understand.  But it's more common to find software companies making solid profits on products they built for others' problems.  Am I overlooking YC companies building products designed for other people?  Is the problem that there just aren't enough potential founders like the Octopart guys: people deeply involved in some non-computing world who also happen to be good programmers?  If so, maybe the richest source of ideas and cofounders would be cruising web forums for the near-programmers (people who build things like MS Access half-solutions to their companies' problems) to listen to what they would like to build if only they knew how. Maybe YC should be recruiting there, too.  Thoughts?",comment,

Besides, why compete with a free product?</i>  Once I actually visited the site and read the philosophy, however, I have to concede that it's at least worth a shot.  This idea is clearly the result of someone saying, ""What is wrong with Wikipedia, and how can we fix it?""  The main problems, as I see it, are:<p>1. Defacing of high-profile articles. - This is potentially solved by requiring the use of real names, and also by the oversight.<p>2. Perceived inaccuracy. - While Wikipedia does at times have inaccuracies, the reality is that the media and others who do not often use it have an exaggerated view of the extent of the inaccuracy. By adding expert oversight, this should quell some of the cries regarding lack of reliability.<p>The only potential problems I see is that Wikipedia already has a lot of inertia, which includes a much better name.  Citizendium is just too hard to say to become a buzzword.  It will also see much slower growth, and I posit that it will never be able to reach the size of Wikipedia, because its growth function is inherently less steep.<p>That said, one could contend that the majority of quality articles on Wikipedia are submitted by a very small minority of the users.  If even some of these authors move to Citizendium due to frustration with the constant maintenance of their articles or the incorrect perception of inaccuracy, then Citizendium truly has a chance.

Alex3917,,6791,[6941],,1175052441,,"""It's exciting to think we may be on the cusp of another shift like the one from farming to manufacturing.""<p>The biggest reason why startups are so much more feasible now than ever before is because of the plummeting costs of production. Whereas twenty years ago it would have taken millions of dollars to do a startup, today a college kid with a powerbook can do one in his dorm room. Every year the tools of production get exponentially more powerful and less expensive.<p>To play devil's advocate, these same factors that are currently driving startups may ultimately be their demise as well. Almost every tool can be used for both good and evil. A hammer can be used to drive a nail, or also to harm someone. Governments have taken it on themselves to try to allow the good uses of any given technology while regulating the evil purposes. The problem is that every time they try to regulate away an evil, there is inevitably a little spill over that prevents us from using the technology for good. Every time a powerful new technology is invented, we end up losing little bits of our rights and civil liberties. <p>As technologies exponentiate in both their power and interconnectedness, it seems as if society (at least ours) will go down the road of increasingly restricting freedoms in order to prevent terrorism and other evils.<p>It isn't hard to imagine that as the costs of production approach zero, so will the freedoms that enable us to start startups. In many countries, such as Japan and Germany, it is so hard to do anything other than the status quo that it is effectively illegal. In Germany the government subsidizes the wages of students finishing school, which makes it effectively impossible to get a job without graduating. And in Japan it's even worse.<p>If the past is any indicator, the same forces driving the boom in startups are ultimately going to be drivers in forcing people into more restrictive social structures. <p>N.B. I don't necessarily believe this, but I think it is a serious argument that has never really been rebutted. Perhaps because the guy who proposed the idea was driven insane by it is currently doing life in prison for killing a bunch of people (Kaczynksi).",comment,

However, if it's clear from the start that no structure will be provided, they won't waste time waiting.  On the other side, managers may get upset if employees don't follow policy with military precision, despite the fact that military structure hasn't been provided and the relevant policy is 30 pages deep in a handbook no one has read in 2 years.

I do think, however, that you are right in saying that it is very hard to rebut the idea that you present.<p>I don't really think, though, that what you present are the precise beliefs of Kaczynski.  In your comment, you seem to have the idea that decreasing costs of production (which is largely due to improvements in technology) is a good thing, while the decrease in freedom is the thing that is bad.  It seems to me that anarcho-primitivists actually believe that technology itself is the bad thing, because it departs from the pure, hierarchy-less society of hunter-gatherers.<p>It is truly an interesting endeavor to consider where the boundary exists between what is good about where we are headed and what is bad.  I think that all of us accept the idea that those who have greater drive and motivation to succeed should be rewarded for their efforts, and it's also hard to deny PG's contention that people now are living more luxurious lifestyles than kings of yesterday (heated houses year 'round).  We may also argue that if people are content with their station in life (i.e. doing nothing to change it), then what is the problem?<p>On the other hand, I think that nearly all of us would agree that a situation like that in the Matrix would be a bad thing; even though the people believe they are living well, it is all a facade.  Additionally, we are perfectly okay with improving the lives of friends and family members who have been less driven than we, presumably because we love them.<p>I guess if you consider the implications of that train of thought, if we loved humanity, we would be perfectly fine with sharing everything equally, regardless of the amount of work the individual does, and we thereby arrive back where we started, with hunter-gatherer cultures that have gift societies.  We can even see evidence of this model working in the open source movement today.<p>I'm not really trying to make any points here, I'm just pointing out some interesting questions that your post (and my readings on Kaczynski) brought up in my mind which made me question what I had previously considered to be unquestionable truths.  Perhaps it's not necessary for the entrepreneur's reward to be directly proportional to the amount of wealth the he or she has created, especially considering that with the current state of social stratification, opportunity is certainly not equal.",comment,

vlad,,7100,,,1175122864,,"I think the main part of the ""Jobs-Wozniak"" relationship that people forget to mention is that Jobs approached Wozniak and thought that's what they should market.<p>In other words, you're not a Wozniak just because you're heavily into technology.  Wozniak created a bunch of stuff because he wanted something very useful for himself and he was going to create it on a tight budget.  That is actually what great leaders do (at least according to some leadership books and my own experience)--they don't create something and then force it onto other people.  Nor do they tell people what to do.  They simply start doing it themselves and then other people notice and want to take part.  (In other words, if you want people to do what you're saying, start doing it yourself and people will copy it or want to be around you when you prove it works.  Don't just start telling people what to do.)<p>So, Wozniak is more than a technical guy.  He was exhibiting silent leadership about hardware.  And Jobs was exhibiting leadership in how software should be later on.<p>If you think you want a Jobs, are you a Wozniak to even have such a comparison?  In other words, are you creating a software or hardware product for yourself that makes things so much easier and better that other people notice it and approach you and tell you, we can sell this?  Remember, Wozniak didn't ask anybody. That's the relationship that happened.  Not, ""Oh, you created a bunch of code, let's try to somehow convert it into a business.""  The idea made sense in the first place.<p>So, if you're 100% technical, the best thing to do is to show what you do to everybody.  Don't force it on to them, and don't worry about anybody copying you since if you're clearly enjoying what you're doing and they think it's a worthwhile thing to do, everybody will want to join you.  Remember, if you're a Wozniak, it means you can basically display your ideas everywhere, even to roomfuls of technical people like Woz did, and know that everything will be OK.",comment,

blats,,7210,,,1175149673,,"""Even the founders who fail don't seem to have such a bad time.""<p>I was a founder in a startup that died late last year. It was the hardest I have ever worked, and one of the most challenging things I have ever done. It was frustrating in so many ways and there was amazing amounts of strife involved. In the end the project ran out of money and the products of my labor and imagination are now gathering dust in storage. After all that, without any monetary reward, I would do it all again in a second. The challenge of following my senses through completely unknown territory and the reward of seeing my idea come to life was more then enough to make the whole thing worth it. It was the challenge that drove me. In the end it was the challenge itself that rewarded me even though the company didn't fly.<p> ""A lot of people think they're too young to start a startup. Many are right. The median age worldwide is about 27...""<p>I do agree completely with the idea that adulthood is a state of mind and not an age. I remember my dad asking me ""What do you want?"" when i was somewhere between 18 and 21. My reply at that time was ""I just want to be comfortable."" I remember it quite distinctly. He then told me ""I expect that will change some day, given your creed."" He was right,  and I realized it while in the midst of working my tail off on a project. All I wanted to do was work on my ideas, see them come to life. The discomfort didn't slow me down at all, it was the challenge that I wanted.<p> ""You need a lot of determination to succeed as a startup founder. It's probably the single best predictor of success.""<p>A founder without determination is not going to succeed, but their drive can't cause them to loose perspective. One can dig with a singular purpose and make a big hole, but if it is in the wrong place it does the project no good.<p> ""You don't need to know anything about business to start a startup.""<p>True, but eventually the business skills will be required if the project is to continue. My experiences have taught me that while a viable product is most of the battle, a lack of resources on the business end of a project can stop it in it's tracks. Weather it is the founders themselfs that learn the skills, or outside resources are brought in to help - the skills must be obtained. The lesson I learned is pick the right people to depend on, or depend on yourself. Implementing your ideas is great all in itself, but it is much better if there is someone interesting there to see it when you finish.<p>""If you don't have a co founder, what should you do? Get one.""<p>Be careful! Going into business with someone in the startup environment is a commitment. You will spend allot of time with them and you will have to depend on them constantly. It is almost like a marriage, choose wisely. Good friends do not always make good business partners.<p> ""In a sense, it's not a problem if you don't have a good idea...""<p>I believe that a person's ability to learn, gain skills, and adapt is the most important thing period. You find someone with a carrot, you've just got a carrot. Even if you need a carrot, their value is limited once they give it to you. Find a gardener and you can grow anything you need. Reminds me of some proverb about choosing a fishing pole or a fish.<p> ""This one is real. I wouldn't advise anyone with a family to start a startup.""<p>I agree with this 100%. I did it, and I would not advise it for someone with a choice. My family is amazing and supportive and more then anything else they KNOW me. I have founder pumping through my veins. The startup world is home to me, there is no question that I will be a serial entrepreneur. Good ideas give me goosebumps, unsolved problems give me insomnia. My family supports who I am, so I am able to do what makes me happy. Successfully pouring your soul into a project and being a member of a family at the same time is a learned skill. Play it safe unless you know what you are getting into, or just can't change who you are.<p> ""Start another company? Are you crazy?""<p>See above.<p> ""Be aware, though, that if you get a regular job, you'll probably end up working there for as long as a startup would take, and you'll find you have much less spare time than you might expect.""<p>Working a regular job instead of chasing dreams is still a commitment. Yes, you can work a regular job without thinking about it all the time. You can go to work 8 hours a day 5 days a week and not have it take over the rest of your personal time. Having said that, is it really worth it? Why do something all day that you don't care about? Sounds flawed to me.<p> ""Each person should just do what they need to without anyone telling them.""<p>This throws back to the ""pick carefully"" comment. Your choice in business partners is paramount. There are many many people who will just stand there on the field with the ball looking confused. Within the constraints of a startup you may not have time to figure it out after the fact. Make sure you know they can work, and that they can work with you.<p> ""If you go to work for Microsoft, you can predict fairly accurately what the next few years will be likeÃÂall too accurately, in fact. If you start a startup, anything might happen.""<p>This is part of what attracts me to the role of a founder. Clicking send on an important proposal and not knowing what will happen is like jumping off a bridge for me (with cord of course). I love not knowing, I love the process of finding out. I love the risks you have to take and the rewards you can reap. Anything can happen, and that resonates with me.<p> ""A significant number of would-be startup founders are probably dissuaded from doing it by their parents.""<p>This is a problem I never had. My dad tells a story about having a booth across the aisle from Oracle WAY back when they were both small. He was lead developer on a similar DB app called RDM which was a far more mature and fully featured product at the time. His business leaders thought conservatively, Oracle shot for the stars. The rest is history. My father will never discourage me from chasing my ideas, and my mom just loves to see me glow. He was there, at the time and the place; he chose the steady paycheck.<p> ""Imagine being sad on Sunday afternoons because the weekend was almost over, and tomorrow you'd have to get up and go to work. How did they stand it?""<p>What, as apposed to kicking back - stretching out - and wondering what day it is on Sunday afternoon? Never.. operating by the seat of your pants and living your ideas is the only way to go. Its the best feeling in the world, and the bad times only make the good ones better.<p>[edit] Getting my proverbs straight.",comment,

If you have the confidence, determination and the right support (money, good business partners, etc.) your chances of success are increased.

BrandonM,,7283,"[7503, 7313]",,1175180029,,"The problem with motivation for an undergrad is when you realize that everything doesn't need to be the way it is now.  Let me clarify.  Most of us have been raised our whole lives with the mantra, ""You have to go to college to succeed.""  I know that my parents didn't go to college, and they were always saying, ""You don't want to end up where I am, working in a factory,"" etc.<p>The problem with that model, however, is that a standard undergraduate education is beginning to become old-fashioned and irrelevant.  How many stories do you hear about students going to four years of school only to graduate and be unable to find employment?  While the problem is not nearly as bad in engineering as in other fields, it's still the case that more and more people are going to college, and as a result, a degree doesn't look nearly as great as it did 20 or 30 years ago.<p>I personally have started to become disenfranchised with the college model in the US.  As an undergrad, I have visited some undergraduate committee meetings and talked personally with a few professors, and the bureaucracy of the whole thing is somewhat disgusting.  Even if a professor wants to make a change to the curriculum (for the better), he or she must endure countless meetings and votes, even for something that is clearly a good idea.  It may take a year or more just to make a minor structural change in a few core courses.<p>Moreover, department heads are not much worried about the success (or lack thereof) of undergrads.  For whatever reason, national groups that rank colleges look mainly at entrance criteria, so as long as the college can successfully lock out those students with low ACT scores (which are largely irrelevant), they look good on paper.  Meanwhile, they hire new professors based <i>only</i> on their research and some interviews, without much regard for teaching backgrounds.<p>In the end, once you go off and create your own startup and work on your own projects, you start to see that college is largely not helpful to an undergrad.  The stuff that is stretched out over four years could probably be learned quite easily by most in two or less, if it was all restructured a bit.  College, in effect, is just another corporation, one that is in the business of paying professors and researching new ideas.  It just happens that most professors do not produce enough ideas quickly enough to justify their income, so undergraduate students make up for that by paying tuition.<p>Once you realize that you can be successful without completing (or even starting) your undergrad, the dedication, motivation, and finances necessary to complete college just don't look like such a good trade anymore.  Most courses follow a textbook, anyways, so just buy the textbook, study it yourself, talk to people online, and you will probably do just as well.  The only downside is that you'll be missing that shiny piece of paper.",comment,

Why lose a mortgage (and your wife!) over a dream? If you're married and want to have a family, get a stable job, get a mortgage and take care of your family's future. Not having any money (or very little) for few years can be extremely stressful on a marriage... especially if you're not financially stable. If you're financially stable and have millions in the bank, well, then this does not apply to you and you can do whatever pleases you.<p>2) You won't have as much time since your wife will demand that you spend a lot of time with her. If you're in a startup, your startup will be your wife and your kid and your family for at least a year. You'll be competing against other teams which don't have time limitations and against people who are working 12-14 hr days. You simply won't be able to compete with them.

rfrey,,7325,,,1175186758,,"Hi, Omarish.  The tragedy of the commons (economists call these situations ""negative externalities"") doesn't apply to Web 2.0 in my opinion.  <p>The tragedy of the commons stems from a basic cost/benefit calculation: in business, if something costs you more than you make, you either stop selling it or you go out of business.  The basic problem of a negative externality is that while the profit accrues to an individual, the cost hidden from that individual and is borne by the community.  So a non-viable activity continues to be performed, until the community goes bankrupt. (I.e., the field is depleted and cannot sustain sheep).  Some argue that pollution falls into this category.  (Note that this is not necessarily an argument for private ownership of everything: the principle problem is costs exceeding benefits, and those costs being hidden from producers so that their incentives are misaligned.  Privatization is one way, but probably not the only way, to align incentives.)<p>But in Web 2.0, there are no hidden costs that are depleting the overall store.  Companies pay for their bandwidth, pay for their storage, etc.  No costs are shifted to the community as near as I can tell.  <p>A better model for what you're talking about might be network effects -  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effects"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effects</a>",comment,

In many cases, though, it can be overkill: a waste of bandwidth and programmer time (i.e. it would be unnecessary for the Google home page to use AJAX to display search results).  As an occasional Lynx user, I really appreciate when a site keeps alternate browsers in mind.<p>That said, I agree with jw that catering to users of ancient, insecure browsers is probably a waste of time and a barrier to progress.  I disagree with a strict cost-benefit approach, however.  As an analogy, Microsoft has been benefiting from this phenomenon for years due to hardware companies who only write Windows drivers, while NVidia is a good example of a hardware company which provides open source drivers and receives loyalty and sales opportunities because of it.  Additionally, supporting cell phone users and the visually impaired is certainly a good idea, even if only a small percentage of visitors fall into these categories.<p>Of course, as numerous others mentioned, it's important to be aware of your target audience, but don't be surprised if your actual audience does not necessarily match the one you have in mind.",comment,

I went to a Montessori school from kindergarten through third grade, and I can't stress enough how badly that specific Montessori school failed.  Teachers were distant, more like babysitters than having any kind of structure.  Any project we wanted to work on was fine, but most of us didn't do anything (the equivalent of pretending to work at work).  We'd have to keep track of what we did in journals and get them signed by a teacher, so most of us made up stuff and forged the teacher's signature.  I don't remember learning any mathematics at all back then.  In fact, I'm positive that it wasn't until fourth grade that I got into basic math.  I don't know if that's normal, but my father had been teaching me math outside of school from a very early age, so I was still strong in it.  It's a very strange school system.<p>My final observation is that my Montessori school was so <i>small</i>!  I was a shy kid, and going to a small school from K-3rd grade, then another small school from 4th-8th grade, did not help me to become a social person one bit.  If you do something against the group, everyone will hate you, resulting in more shyness.  Even at third grade.<p>You probably should evaluate your child.  Is s/he shy?  If so, it may be a benefit to send them to a larger school.  I'm not saying that it will cure them of shyness, but it may help.<p>I'll totally respect any decision you make though :)",comment,

If there is some way to know what a teacher taught and how well it worked which other teachers could use as a reference, then it becomes a memory.  Teachers can improve upon other teachers' previous works.  <p>Right now, each public school teacher is almost universally independent.

I'm passionate about somehow improving the lives and education of the average public high school student.  My hypothesis is that the answer is increasing the availability of student-student, student-teacher, and teacher-teacher communication, with the memory pool to store previous content.  The internet is a wonderful thing, however programs like Blackboard fail to take into account group interaction.

This is why I feel it can only be created by a commercial entity, possibly a corporation.<p> Also, I agree that your method of learning is superior, however the entity that creates this must accept that public schools teach in a certain way and change very slowly.<p>Another problem is dealing with online predators.  Any kind of social software created for schools is going to create huge waves of uproar unless people are sure that predators, real or imagined, can't communicate with students.

GMail prints and sends my e-mail to them via snail mail, and RCM scans the mail back into electronic form and e-mails me once a day about it.  It's a really great way to get all of your entire e-mail once a day (two business days later) without being bothered to check for it every 5 minutes.<p>Also, I have a filter set up on gmail that will parse the notification e-mails from RCM about new deliveries and forward them to my vlad-spam@gmail.com e-mail account.

This was the summer of 2000, at the height of the dot-com boom.  The NASDAQ had just peaked, but nobody knew it yet.<p>We got picked up first by the local community newspapers, then the Boston Herald, then the local TV news.  Then we ran out of funding, but we continued getting press inquiries for several months after we were technically out of business.  <p>We had a $20k PR budget (which we inflated to $50k whenever we talked to people), but we never spent any of it.  Instead, our (18 year old) PR guy would just cold call newspaper editors with ""Hi, this is Trip Guray, I'm at an all-teenage startup called inAsphere.com, and we have a story you might be interested in.""  If they weren't interested, fine, we'd say thanks for your time and try someone else.  If they were, we'd send them a press release over e-mail or arrange for an interview.<p>Press coverage tends to snowball: if you get a story published in a community newspaper, you're much more likely to get picked up by a major metropolitan newspaper.

whacked_new,,8111,,,1175483202,,"Here are some thoughts I have regarding popularity meters on news sites and such. Maybe some people would find it interesting or possibly useful. I would also love to hear other opinions, so do share.<p>I am sure many readers here have seen the new SlashRating box, which sports digg-esque (generally speaking) number ratings for each article. Maybe you noticed that the Gmail Paper article (<a href=""http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/0631243.shtml)"">http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/0631243.shtml)</a> and the X-Files article right after it (<a href=""http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/1231211.shtml)"">http://slashdot.org/articles/07/04/01/1231211.shtml)</a> have substantially different SlashRatings (1000x+ difference). Humor aside, they may both be valid ratings. Readers familiar with digg (easy example) have seen ratings ranging from the single digits, to way through the thousands. I believe there is a limit to the informativeness of the number rating. And while many services have jumped onto using similar number-based displays of popularity, here I make a case for the relative measure.<p>As a passer-by, casual reader on digg (which is most readers), when you see a page full of ratings in the hundereds, you probably process only two things from the score: the digit length and leftmost digit. When a 1000+ rating appears, you immediately know from the digit length that it is a magnitude more popular. More than what? More than the surrounding articles. Naturally, your eyes will notice the highest ratings within the page. If you reach a page full of articles rated in the thousands, readers probably apply the same strategy: scan the digit length and the leftmost digit. Unless two or more articles are rated on a higher order of magnitude than the rest, readers would likely ignore the less significant digits -- and when such a comparison is required, the articles are probably popular enough that you read them all.<p>After you mentally shift to a scale of comparison, you ignore details on other orders of magnitude; this is, for example, how your eyes adjust to consistently bright, or dark, environments. Of course numbers are easy to output and fast to read, and details may be interesting and important to the developers, but for browsing efficiency, most readers do not care, nor need to know, if something is rated 4903, or 4692, points, as long as a reference exists for comparison. And this reference will always depend on the number of participating users at a given moment. A better system should thus display only a relative measurement of popularity within a given timeframe. This idea is not necessarily new, but I believe it is definitely a better approach to popularity measurements, and moreso if you are expecting your project to eventually support a large votership.<p>An existing example to illustrate good use of this is something like a community download site. Say something is ""popular"" when over 50% of the users download it. It makes more sense then, to just write ""popular"" when total_downloads / total_users  0.5, rather than showing ""1,040 downloads!"", or even ""5,503,395 downloads!"" (okay, millions is different... but if your users were, like, ants, big deal). In the end, ""popularity"" is a relative measure.<p>I'm sure many folks here have thoughts on related issues; let's hear them :)",comment,

The two-term formula was obtained by classifying the almost-injective functions using a regular grammar; the closed term arose from a sub-language closed under concatenation. Computer experiments suggest that a class of enumeration problems arising from regular monoids have closed form hypergeometric enumeration formulas. <p>Finding an algorithm for computing closed forms of indefinite binomial coefficient sums was an open problem in Knuth's Art of Programming; it was solved by Wilf and Zeilberger. In the example I considered, there is no closed form solution; however there is a way of finding a  decomposition of the sum with good properties.

I went to a workshop a few weeks ago that was hosted by the Stern School of Business - they had a panel of VCs and one Angel Investor, a startup business pitching to them, and an audience full of people able to ask questions. What was interesting was that one of the first questions the VCs asked after the pitch was ""do you have any patents?"" The answer was a pretty straight-forward ""no."" BUT, when asked about it later by someone in the audience, all of the VCs agreed that they didn't really care that the team didn't have anything patented - that they'd rather see a startup spending their time and energy on implementation than on developing a patent portfolio. Really, they just asked the question because they HAVE to ask the question.<p>I think the larger question here is ""why can't someone else do what you're doing?"" and the ""do you have any patents?"" question is the first logical step in answering that.

rms,,8477,[8485],,1175587262,,"It seems like you're looking for a perfect answer as to how Granmos or Parakey could become one of the top three operating systems. I don't have the exact solution, but I know there is an enormous market and I wouldn't need ten million users to have a company worth acquiring. If I knew how to market Granmos to the point of becoming a monopoly crushing success I would probably already be getting paid millions as a consultant. I know Granmos can be successful, even if it doesn't reach the ten million user mark.<p>PR is a very important way of marketing for Granmos. You can do a local newspaper press release. Write an article about how a college student is making it easy for his grandparents to use computers. Send it to every local newspaper in America. Get new users. This is the kind of thing you can do for free, but professional PR people do it better.<p>Maybe I could do something really crazy, like giving stock options to anyone who acts as an evangelist or developer.<p>As for advertising, it would mainly be cost-per-action style ads.  Affiliate links for online shops and such. You can do things like pitch a free magazine subscription offer at users. Those affiliate programs can pay $5 per action. Also there's the money you get when someone searches Google through your site. The important thing is to stick to advertisements that have some kind of benefit for the user.<p>Tracking the referrals isn't a hard problem.

I am a 3rd-yr. undergrad, and I'm itching to finish school and start a company. <p>I study Computer Science, and I love it, and I would love to continue studying it in graduate school.

I could apply for a Master's in C.S., but then I would be putting my life of for another 2 years.<p>I feel that school sometimes creates a disillusioned sense of learning among students. I have to constantly remind myself that I could learn anything I've learned in school on my own time, and that I can continue to do so even after I graduate, and even after I retire.<p>This isn't true of a lot of people. School certainly offers a strong sense of competition, along with access to bright students and accomplished faculty. I feel like each semester is an orgy of learning, if you will, in which I am focused and determined to intensely work and succeed. But during winter and summer breaks, there is not much difference...<p>I love to learn and would love to continue school, but in a sense, it restricts you to its curriculum.

It all came down to three things:<p>1. We wanted to show potential employers that we were smart enough to get into an elite private college.<p>2. We wanted to show potential employers that we were docile and persistent enough to continue attending said elite private college, even though we had accomplished #1.<p>3. We wanted to get to know lots of other people who were willing to pay $40K/year for the privilege of #1 and #2.<p>Of course, once you get out in the working world and actually get involved in hiring decisions, you quickly learn that there's not <i>that much</i> difference in the quality of education at various universities.  Harvard's classroom instruction is not much better than any other top-tier college, and may actually be worse.  MIT's is probably better, but it's nothing that a couple of guys from UVA (ahem, Reddit) can't pick up in their spare time.<p>Instead, you look at the Education section on a resume because people have already done the hard work for you.  Someone at Harvard painstakingly went through 18 years of that candidate's life and decided that they were good enough for Harvard.  I've got code to write: I don't have time to spend digging through a candidate's background.  If it's good enough for Harvard, it's good enough for me.<p>So, the business idea I came up with was a simple certification program.  We'd look at all your test scores, administer a few additional tests, have you complete a project or two, talk to previous people you've worked with, and generally decide if you're worthy or not.  We'd set the bar high enough that the average Harvard or MIT grad would fail.  And if you pass, we give you a college degree - all without having to put up with the bullshit aspects, like going to classes or forking over a couple hundred dollars.  You're responsible for your own education, we just say whether you've educated yourself.<p>I wonder if I should've put this down under ""other ideas"" on my yCombinator app.",comment,

I'm just glad to see someone might be doing something cool to circumvent the current college standard. <p>As much as i talk about college being a big fat waste of time and money, I generally enjoyed my time spent there. I had an awesome marketing job with one of the greatest companies/brands in the world and made some stellar contacts. It was the job offers halfway through college that showed me that the experience was worth MUCH more than the diploma. Finding out that jobs that ""require"" college degrees really just require proof that you are capable and determined was a great realization. <p>If you can demonstrate to a company that you have what it takes, waiting for you to finish your degree could be a waste of time for all parties involved. <p>So if your goal is to get a good job... it is entirely possible without a degree. Your friends and family may tell you otherwise, and very few people will encourage you to drop out to take a job... but it's your decision. Having a degree hardly dictates your happiness or success as a person. <p>I ended up leaving school after 3.5 years. Not to take a job, just because it was clearly a waste of my time. I wanted to focus on starting/building my company, and school was just getting in the way of that. Incidentally I found (sorta like Seth) a way that I could get my last semester's worth of credits from my university - so i'll still have that ""all mighty piece of paper"" in a couple months.<p>My suggestion to people usually is: Do what you want! Fitting the social norm is easy and will probably work out for you, but it might not be the best choice. If I were to go to college again, I'd study something that interested me as a person. Not something that I felt was a happy medium between interesting and a safe career path. <p><i></i><i></i><i> You should go to college to learn about something you think is cool & enjoy your time spent there. Study art or music, history of physics... something that will make you want to attend early morning class discussions. Get involved on campus, network with people, and use your free-time to read and figure out how you're going to make your mark. If you're just going to school to prepare for a job... rethink why you'd spend your time and money being lectured and quizzed on material from drab books who's curriculum is behind the times anyway. If you are planning to start a company, you'll know for yourself if college is important to you or not. <p>",comment,

A college degree is not supposed to just be a certification that you are competent over a certain domain of facts, but rather an indication that you have spent 3-4 years thinking, applying yourself, and growing intellectually.<p>While autodidactism is certainly laudable, there is value in a corporate educational setting, namely the value of intellectual interaction.  College is not so much about learning a set of data, but learning how to learn.

Short answer, yes.<p>First, the way things are structured tax-wise, C corporations get to deduct founder health insurance 100%, so that's the most tax-advantaged scenario.  If you pay for your own personal health insurance or do it as a sole proprietorship, etc. you're basically getting a raw deal from Congress.<p>I'm in California, where basically any 2+ person small business that's been around about like 3-6 months is guaranteed group health insurance for its employees at no more than 10% over an index that represents what bigger companies pay.  It's a sweet deal.  So if you're in California and are going to go this route, you may want to incorporate ahead of time to start that clock ticking.<p>So basically the company pays for the insurance for the founders, even though they're not drawing a salary.

My high school was basically founded around that premise, and I completely bought into it then.

You learn how to learn by butting your head up against a problem, reading everything you can about what other people have already done on the problem, trying different approaches until one works, and moving on to the next problem.  After you've repeated this a few hundred times, you start figuring out which approaches are likely to work and which aren't.<p>The Ph.D is a good example.  There are plenty of people that are ""ABD"" (All But Dissertation) - they've gone through all the coursework, been taught all that their instructors can teach them, but nobody considers them ""real"" Ph.Ds.  Why?  Because the meat of a Ph.D program is actually going out and <i>doing original research</i>, and someone who hasn't done the research doesn't really know how to do the research.<p>The point of a certification program is to decouple the act of learning from the act of judging how much has been learned.

Leonidas,,8806,[8819],,1175699560,,"Actually, health insurance is an important factor.  If you catch pneumonia or the flu, you're looking at getting knocked out for 2 months (pneumonia resulting from a ""cold"" that was not properly handled), 2 weeks (flu) without medical intervention.  Personally, I'd rather take some meds and be back on my feet in 3-5 days than not be able to afford to see a doc or take some meds....putting my startup behind which would kill me more than an illness.  Without insurance you're looking at least $110 for per doctor visit and about $90 bucks and up depending on what meds you need (PER prescription). Or let's say you broke your arm or leg because you tripped on your shoe laces while walking down the stairs of the Y Combinator building.   Without insurance you're looking at about $2500 and up to get it fixed and that doesn't include the cost of seeing a doctor added into it.<p>Paying $120 bucks a month to cover potential injuries or finding affordable medical insurance and covering yourself for potential injuries is a definitely an important factor not only for yourself, your company, but also to prevent you from getting your co-founders sick.  <p>It is true that if you're younger you are less likely to get sick.  However, if you are under a substantial amount of stress, your immune defense will drop and your chances of getting sick increases.  That's why you see a lot of people get sick during mid terms and exams.<p>So for all of you who are in a startup, I suggest you get at least 1000-2000mg of Vitamin C. Clinical trials have shown that taking 1000-2000mg (usually an 8oz glass of OJ, depending on type of OJ) of Vitamin C a day provides prophylactic use (prevents the occurrence) against acute stress induced illnesses.<p><p><p><p>",comment,

If you list that you do not have insurance, the  nurse or secretary to will tell you how much it will be without insurance to verify that you can pay the cost. If you go to a ""doctor's office"" he has the right to deny you services if you can't pay (only for non-emergency incidences).  However, if you are in an extreme emergency such as a heart attack or you're dying, he cannot refuse you his services due to the hippocratic oath.<p>However, doctors in hospitals are different.  If you go to the ER (hospital related) the hospital doctor is REQUIRED to see you by US law...without verification of ability to pay.   For doctors in hospitals, this is a big problem because we cater to a lot of homeless patients who walk out and do not pay...and of course one can't do anything about it since they're homeless.<p>Anywhoo, if you get treated in a HOSPITAL, always request an ITEMIZED list of charges.

While this makes a case for writing fashionably, it also means that really good writings are valued for content; good content can be expressed without strict adherence to guidelines. Rap, for example. It makes no sense to proofread rap.<p>In any case, there are no absolute rules for language use. This point is stronger when you have a large readership, and even stronger, when your readership has the ability to talk directly to the author, and perhaps even contribute.<p>The challenge is to be able to accomodate a huge number of these copy editors, who come and go as they please, shout or whisper their preferences, and somehow make the end useful and actually better.",comment,

That's my job anyway, and honestly I believe execution is more difficult than having high-level ideas.  <p>In practice, I try and hire people that have blogs wherein they showed knowledge as well as serious and deep thinking about the type of problems I want to hire them to solve. <p>The only person I've ever truly thought did an excellent job I hired this way. I didn't know him. I didn't look at a resume. I had one conversation with him. I just read his blog, and I could tell from his writing that he would do a good job. Actually, his blog was just his fiction writing and he was a UI designer and coder but I could still tell from his thinking. He was so smart--a structured, logical, deep and creative thinker. It was clear to me that he would do a good job. He did. I tend to be a perfectionist, and he was the only person I've ever hired that did a perfect job. I had absolutely no criticisms about him. He always exceeded my expectations. It was amazing. I love working with the best people--nothing is more fun.  <p>If they didn't have a blog, I'd tell them to write down their thoughts every day for a few weeks and then I'd read it. I believe that you can't tell anything about anyone except how they behave over time. People lie and misrepresent themselves. But it's pretty much impossible to misrepresent yourself over a period of time. <p>I might try and give them a few of my problems to work on as well. But, if someone isn't the quickest thinker and can't answer a problem I give them in an hour-long interview I really don't care. What if they're amazing problem solvers but they just take overnight? One of the smartest people I know is like this. <p>With a blog, or writing over time, you also get a sense of how well they can articulate their ideas--if they have amazing ideas but they can't articulate them well, then the quality of their ideas doesn't matter. If for some reason they're terrible writers but still smart, you can just have them create a podcast. If they can't do either, then they can't articulate themselves enough to be useful to a company.<p>Watching their thinking over time, you can see how many ideas they generate, since you don't just want people that will only solve the problems you have. You want people that see things you can't and generate ideas themselves. <p>I don't care about how well people fit in. A start-up isn't a clique of best friends, although you certainly need people that you can be bluntly honest with and can be bluntly honest with you. It's better if you like them, of course, but I'm never trying to build any kind of culture except a culture of excellence--well, excellence on deadline. <p>Another thing I've always wanted to try is just to hire someone for two weeks and give them non-critical tasks to do.

The reality is that it is screwing over all the other investors in the company by saying that the VC goes to the front of the line, gets all their money back, and <i>then</i> gets the percentage of anything left over comensurate with their percentage ownership of the company.   The implication being that employees have not actually invested in the company and if there's anything left over, then the employees and founders get some. <p>This is particularly insulting given that the liklihood of this preference being relevant is increased by taking VC money-- which in this day and age means forgoing almost certain profitability for a higher risk shot at hitting it out of the ballpark. <p>And the price for putting a bomb under your company and lighting the fuse?

dageroth,,9150,[9208],,1175773242,,"I don't think that a central authority is necessary for money to work, at least not in form of a monopolist. Actually the current systems are rather unsatisfying because a state can loose its credibility and thus the trust in its curreny quite fast, basically as soon as war looms on the horizon or it becomes apparent that it will default on its debt. In the last 25 years over 87 currencies crashed. And because of the monopoly of the state on money the whole economy is usually going down along. For my part I would therefore abandon the monetary monopoly of the state and allow competition, allow companies to issue money. When they connect their name to the currency and have no legal power to make their money legal tender they will have a much stronger incentive to provide a good and stable money. Hayek wrote a fascinating treatise on the denationalisation of money, and with the ongoing globalisation sooner or later we will get used to juggle with more than one currency in our pockets. Second Life seems to be a step in the direction that companies start to issue private currencies and when states, especially in the developing countries, will fail to keep their currency stable chances are that they will be replaced by private currencies. <p>Equally interesting and probably easier to believe are gold backed currencies with competing private institutes issuing goldbacked money.<p>Still, its great to see people thinking about money in another way than just how to get it.",comment,

BrandonM,,9177,[9422],,1175782297,,"In a few of Paul Graham's essays and in some of my own experiences, I have found that Lisp is a very powerful language for hard programming problems, largely due to its powerful macro facilities.  These macros give the programmer the power to create entirely new, domain-specific languages without too much difficulty.<p>I am currently a Master's student and I hope to eventually be a founder, and my question is the title of this submission.  I can understand why some people would shy away from Lisp, but I also see how many upcoming programmers appreciate the power of Python and Ruby.  I believe, then, that the next big language will be one that combines the macros of Lisp with the ease of use of Python.  I think that such a language would be perfect for startups.<p>I am a glutton for punishment, so my graduate interests lie in programming languages.  Here at Ohio State University, there is a language called RESOLVE that a lot of students don't like too much (it's built on top of C++ and is much too wordy), but it does have some interesting concepts built-in that I would like to put in a language of my own.

You could make the case that you could be working a higher-paying job in that time, but then you are missing out on the flexibility of being a Ph.D., which allows the possibility of being a professor or getting hired for a pretty high income.  Additionally, you have the opportunity to leave your mark on the field with your research.<p>Even more interesting is that Ph.D. work could lead you to your startup idea, as you unveil a new use of existing technology or a new approach altogether which leads to a money-making possibility.

Benja,,9279,,,1175792059,,"But, of course, you don't have to have code files full of parens in order to have s-expressions. Alternative syntaxes have never taken hold in the Lisp world, which <i>may</i> mean they just offer nothing to an experienced Lisp hacker, but they're certainly not impossible.<p>You can have user-definable infix operators; Haskell has them and uses them to good effect. (The way Haskell does it, you can't have identifiers composed of both letters and operator characters, which Lisp people like to do, but I think we can safely treat that as a matter of taste.) You pick a symbol, say ~, and assign it a precedence and left- or right-associativity:<p>infixr 3 ~<p>infixl 7 .!.<p>Now (x ~ y .!. z) is parsed as ((~) x ((.!.) y z)), where (~) is the Haskell way of making the ~ operator as a prefix function. Haskell also lets you use a prefix function as an infix operator, by putting backquotes around it.<p>If you want to apply this in Lisp, there is the issue that (foo) means something else than foo; I would like to allow (foo x + bar y) to mean ((+) (foo x) (bar y)), but I wouldn't want (x + y) to mean ((+) (x) (y)). My solution would be that a single value is parsed as just a value, but multiple values next to each other is a function call: (foo x + y) is ((+) (foo x) y), to call y without parameters you have to write (foo x + (y)).<p>This leaves you with the parantheses for control structures and the like. If you like layout-based languages, you can adopt the rule that ""expression + colon + newline + indented expression 1 + indented expression 2 + ..."" is parsed as  ""expression (indented expression 1) (indented expression 2) ..."".<p>Some examples of code from On Lisp formatted like this:<p><a href=""http://himalia.it.jyu.fi/~benja/2007/layoutedlisp.txt"">http://himalia.it.jyu.fi/~benja/2007/layoutedlisp.txt</a><p>Of course, it still looks like Lisp, with less parens.",comment,

rebecca_d,,9300,,,1175795954,,"These are the precise questions that my startup, Knowitall.tv, is trying to answer. What will advertising look like as video programming and advertising dollars shift to the web? Where are those advertising dollars going to go, who will decide on the content these dollars will fund, and who will provide this content?<p>I think the most important thing Garfield notes in this article is the huge shift in power has occurred with the advent of dvr and web video. People don't have to sit through flashy, in-your-face ads that shout 'buy me!.' These ads can be fast-forwarded or deleted. On the web, the attention span of the viewer is drastically reduced by the sheer volume and choice of content. Why would I watch an ad when I don't have to on this site over here? The audience is no longer captive. The student has become the teacher. We are in charge. <p>Advertising and networks are not doomed in any sense.  However, traditional, 'flashy' ads will have to be replaced by more informative, interactive, gentle, pull advertising content. Think product placement, contests, video games, informational videos... Ad content will also be interactive-the best way to extend the short-attention span of the average web user. Just because networks are reeling in costs does in no way mean that they are 'over.'      Yes, traditional purveyors of advertising and large networks should be concerned, but only if they do not adapt to this huge shift in power. These networks and ad companies became successful because of innovation and I am sure they will temper the storm. However, who should be taking close note of this market shift is ambitious independent producers and content providers. There is a huge gap in the market for a few companies to sneak in and make an absolute killing. <p>To summarize: Because the viewer is in charge, ads in the future will inform rather than entertain, engage rather than impress, so really, the only question to answer is, what do the end users want to know and from whom? I believe local expertise and endorsement to be the untapped goldmine of this 'new' advertising.",comment,

Much better to make the initial mistakes on someone else's dime.<p>Problem is, my day job seems to move at a glacial pace.  So despite having a 6 month handicap and about 1/5 the number of man-hours available, my startup may launch first.  If that happens, I'll probably quit the day job whether it's done or not, because it's just a drag on the startup.",comment,
BitGeek,,9415,"[9438, 9418]",,1175811144,,"You missed his point.   Yes, what you are doing is replicating the situation that worked for you.  And this program is probably a good one for students who are still in college and want to build a company over the summer. <p>But anyone who has left college and is working for a living should be able to save up one months living expenses every month. (EG: make 25 an hour, gross $4k, $3.6k after taxes, live on $1,500 a month or so.)   Thus if you work for 6 months as a contract programmer (or better yet as an employee for a startup) you will then have 6 months of expenses to build your business.  Thus there's no reason that not getting YC funding should be an impediment to strting a business.<p>The strong impression I get from people who post here, and the people who attented startupschool is that they are focused on getting funding.  They want to go to YC, or move to the bay area for connections to funding.  Landing a VC deal is seen as the end goal.  <p>This is not an entreprenurial focus.  Were you focused on VC funding for viaweb, or were you trying to build a business?<p>The original poster is right-- build a business-- that should be the focus.  Not getting funding.  Not worrying about what you're going to do if you don't get into YC.  YC should be seen as a possible opportunity, but not critical to success. <p>And since YC only happens twice a year and is limited in the number accepted... waiting for the next round of YC indicates that building the business or product is not the number one priority.<p>As an investor, I'd rate highly someone who was living off of their own savings to build their product-- they have shown the gumption and have even more skin in the game.",comment,

However, that's totally unnecessary! I've certainly done that when I was a teen, but have found the charitable approach much more effective. Let me be clear that 'charitable' does not mean unclear or deceptive in the breakup. On the contrary - it's being very clear and honest about the breakup with the girl. That being said, you <i>do</i> withhold any information that would unnecessarily hurt her (ex: you're not attracted to something about her that she can't help).<p>The breakup needs to establish that:<p>1) the relationship is not a match for you, but that that is no reflection on her personally in the slightest<p>2) you genuinely admire the N number of amazing things about her<p>3) you hope that you both can still be good friends, but that you understand and honor her wish if she thinks it's better not to<p>4) the romantic possibilities of your relationship are just not there sufficient for marriage and never will be (let her move on with closure!) Don't worry, if you change your mind later you can crawl back on your knees to her and tell her you were wrong - but you have to let her go and pursue other possibilities.<p>5) you are open to talk with her about it at any time - this will usually relieve a lot of her anxiety about having to wonder why you broke up later.<p>Note: Be careful about the 'still being friends' thing. If you are hanging out too much with her, most other guys will avoid asking her out - and you don't want to hinder her ability to move on. Be sure to honor her space and let her know that you are doing that so she doesn't feel rejected by it.<p>Success stories:<p>2004 girlfriend: Good breakup, she decided it was better for her to not have contact. I honored that and imagine she has gone on to great things.<p>2005 girlfriend: Good breakup, though we did get back together several times. Ultimately it ended, but our communication was so good that we have remained best friends since then and talk regularly about our new relationships. We both are huge advocates of each other - she sells me to other girls and I sell her to other guys. We do business together too since there is such a high level of trust.<p>2006 girlfriend: Had a great time together, but we both knew it wouldn't work. We had great communication and though it was hard for me to let her go, I did and that really impressed her to the point where we have a similar high-trust, high-advocate relationship as with 2005 girlfriend.<p>2007 girlfriend: Ended about a week ago. So far so good. Very hard for both of us. But we've had good communication since and it is evolving well into a good friend relationship.<p>Note that these tips assume that you are only dating reasonably sane girls - with psycho chics this probably won't apply ;)<p>It's important to remember that going the charitable route is often harder in the short-term than the alternatives, but it's important to suck it up and have the kahoonas to do it right. Some guys may be tempted to not give her a clean break or feel they have to diminish her as a person to satisfy their own insecurities. DON'T DO IT! Seriously, it will hammer your karma and make life much more difficult for you in the long-term. To illustrate: 2006 girlfriend only dated me because of the good things 2005 girlfriend told her about how good our relationship and breakup was. The same with 2007 girlfriend.

We spent a week or two struggling over answering question just right. We had no product, and had not yet considered some of the questions the application was asking. As you may guess we got an email from YC in late October saying: <p>--- "" We're sorry to say that we can't accept your proposal for funding. Please don't take it personally, because most of the proposals we rejected, we rejected for reasons having nothing to do with the quality of the applicants.  For example, we were very reluctant to accept proposals with only one founder, because we think starting a startup is too much work for one person.  We also rejected a lot of proposals simply because we couldn't understand them, or didn't understand the problem domain well enough to judge them, or because the project seemed too big to start on only three months of funding.<p>We realize this process is fraught with error. It's practically certain that groups we rejected will go on to create successful startups.

We just kept talking about our idea for Revvu.<p>In doing some soul searching though, I decided I had to turn down these job offers and stop wasting time in school. This is not the life I wanted. After talking to my co-founder we came to grips with the fact that... working regular jobs was the default. That was the easy way to go about life, but we wanted more than that. We are too creative and determined to be held back or stifled by the nuances of a ""job"". <p>In January I moved across the country to live with my co-founder and work full time on our project.

We weren't ready before. We were sitting around waiting to hear back from YC in October, and nearly let our passion fade after not being accepted. <p>This time filling out the application didn't take long at all, because we actually knew our answers.

In much the same way, a diligent sandwich maker will smear a smidgen of jam evenly over his bread, rather than leaving it concentrated in one corner, and so make the whole more savoury.<p>...In its full splendour, PCP asserts that any statement S whose validity can be ascertained by a proof P written over n bits also admits an alternative proof, Q. This proof Q has two appealing features: it can be derived from P in a number of steps proportional to n^c, where c is some constant; and P can be verified by examining only three bits of Q picked at random. If S is true, a correct P will satisfy the verifier with a probability of 99%. If it is not true, any alleged proof P will trigger a rejection from Q with a probability higher than 50% (ref. 4). Not impressed with this error rate? Then all you have to do is pick, instead of three bits of Q, as many bits as are contained in this line of text. The error probability will drop to one in a billion.""",comment,

He couldn't remember the order of operations, so he was having trouble parsing the statement:<p>(forall x, y in Z)(x &gt;= y AND x &lt;= y ==&gt; x = y)<p>That led him to ask why should I not just include the unnecessary parens, i.e. ((x &gt;= y AND x &lt;= y) ==&gt; x = y), which then led to the question of where to stop adding parentheses.  Finally, he recalled talking to another professor who made the case that having rules for order of operations is a bad idea (because those rules have to be memorized), and why not just parenthesize everything?  I pointed out, of course, that he was almost exactly describing Lisp.<p>That thought, however, led me to consider the idea of making order of operations always evaluate left-to-right, except for parenthesized expressions, which would be evaluated first (in the same manner).

bigtoga,,9549,,,1175852692,,"I don't know how long you guys have been working from home but I'll provide a little insight from someone who's been doing it mostly for about 12 years. I've been working at home with various projects/jobs since I was about 24 (36 now). For the first 2-3 years, it was all part-time of 2-4 days a week but, for the past decade, it's been full-time. <p>I tell you - even 12 years on, it is still hard to do. I do a lot of traveling  as a consultant and trainer and these are usually Monday through Friday gigs. When I get back to the ""office"" and start to work again on Monday, I've totally lost the groove lol. That's it - it only takes a week of me getting out of the mindset of working at home to lose it. When I come back to the office on Monday, I want to read reddit, catch up on all the stuff I missed and I almost always find that Mondays have a lot of wasted time in them lol. <p>It took me probably 2-3 years initially to get the mindset down and learn how to separate work from play. Distractions are huge at home but, for a 20-something with no significant other, they are less so. Now, I have a spouse and a fun little three year old at home - those are more distracting than all the strip clubs and PS3s in the world lol. But you manage. <p>Last bit - I would suggest that, when you are looking for a spouse/significant other, make sure that person is okay with a comment like, ""Honey, I'm going into work now. I want you to think as though my office is 30 miles away from you and you can't just walk in and ask me a question. Send me an email or phone me if you have a question. Also, don't ask me stupid shit during the day because I'm dealing with complex stuff and inane prattle takes me out of the mindset I need to work.""

This is because we are aiming for the warm and fuzzies (serving the needs of a specific community of users), and almost all mash-ups that I've seen lack the warm and fuzzies because the Google Maps API limits their ability to custom-tailor their service and presentation.

True, no product campaign these days is complete without a rebranding of the web itself. <p>As advertising has undergone a power shift, from the content providers to the users, advertising has somehow become a bad word. Now that end users decide what and how products will be pitched, advertising seems to stand not only for traditional, flashy, in-your-face ads, but for any product communication that has already occurred. In that sense,  advertising is perpetually over, and therefore always omnipresent.  <p>Simply put, as more and more people research products and services online, making purchasing decisions online, and actually buy online, it seems preposterous to claim that advertising, and companies that are in the business of advertising, are in anyway passe. It is inconsistent with the evolution of the web. <p>What I like about Komisar-backed Aggregate Knowledge is that it is creating the platform for some wonderful advertising streams. Right now, as I understand it, they are touting as part of their product targeting by the Psychology of Crowds, or the beginning of building psychological profiles of buyers. This is done on many shopping sites: If person 1 buys product A, then he will, based on group research, be interested in product B and product C and should be presented with B and C in a non-obtrusive fashion.   What this should naturally evolve into is a better targeting-being able to differentiate between types of buyers; is she an impulse buyer that might be wooed by a flashy interface, or is she a research shopper, who needs a case study to buy? Merely providing relevant content, without the proper packaging for the individual (what I think to be the advertising formerly know as advertising) is deficient.    Also, what is the ideal interface complexity of this shopper? For instance, in person people buy less in big stores because they are overwhelmed by the sheer number of options. They are more likely to buy products in a smaller store. People are more influenced by items placed at the front of the store as their shopping goals are more malleable as they enter. Not to say that these findings will translate directly to shopping behavior on the web, but we will soon have the ability to create the perfect shopping environment for an individual, and advertising will be big part of it.",comment,

Right now I am browsing for office spaces in the SF area and Peninsula area in craigslist to see the price ranges and what's available.  But it's really just surveying now since it's impossible to decide on it without more feedback and definite interest.  But what I'm shooting for is cheap location with good parking and hopefully some windows to sun light.  I am estimating 200 sq ft per member (100-150 for actual cube space, depending on single person or group, and extra spaces for walkways, lunch area, bathroom, etc).  So I guess once there's more feedback, you guys can help me out in hunting down good locations in either craigslist or other sources.  Base on my fuzzy math of 200 sq ft/cube,  we should be aiming for ~$1/sq ft (hopefully less, depending on location, etc.) in order get it down to the ~$250/member/month mark.  Of course, that's just fuzzy math, I'm sure we'll have to adjust that once we know the actual # of signups and what they want.

We introduce the 32 base pair deletion in the CCR5 gene and grow the cells in culture. These can then be ""transplanted"" back into the patient. These transplanted stem cells will create HIV immune T cells. Once there are enough immune T cells, the patient will probably still have HIV, but it will not develop into AIDS. There will be no chance of rejection since they are the patient's own cells. Furthermore, since the body does produce antibodies to HIV, these modified T cells may even be able to fight off the HIV.<p>To test this, we would get a mouse line, which are genetically very similar to each other from inbreeding so we won't have to worry about rejection of the transplants, and introduce the human CCR5 receptor into them. This, in theory, will allow the mice to be infected with HIV since HIV attaches to the CCR 5 receptor to enter and infect the cell. If this works, we can then try the technique of taking some of their stem cells, introducing the mutation, transplanting them back in, and see if their T cell count increases or if the levels of HIV decrease.

In that sense, yeah Windows is dead.  Personally, I use Macs, so I am well insulated from Microsoft.  However, they are alive and well if only because of the Office suite.  If I send a an OpenDocument file to ten of my friends, they won't be able to open it.  If I send a Word file, everybody can open it.  The point is, Microsoft is still quite relevant today.  Although, I can see your points and would fully agree that free Linux could easily supplant Windows as a desktop environment (to run your stated Web 2.0 apps) or Macs.  I applaud your essay; you take some interesting positions and provide some profound insight.  Very interesting.  Brad Engelmann.",comment,

What is the product supposed to do? A corollary is to ask, what can a user do with my product that he can't do without it? The answer to these questions should be a single, simple, focused answer.<p>2. What is the absolute minimum feature set we must have in order for the product to do what the user needs? Question EVERYTHING. If you're designing an email product, ask yourself if you even need folders. If you're designing a MS Word killer, ask yourself if you even need a Save. If you're designing a media player, ask yourself if even need a play/pause button.<p>After you have the minimum feature set, release the software and iterate quickly based on user feedback. Nothing can replace raw feedback from strangers who don't give a crap about you or your product. See what the users like and dislike about the product, based on first hand observation. <p>More tricky is keeping the product simple in response to user feature demands. Adding features is good, but only when you do it in such a way that it complements your answer to the original question: ""What is the product supposed to do?"" <p>You have to think about how each and every additional feature deeply integrates into your existing product, rather than tacking features on haphazardly.

Also, the files can be huge, and in a web-hosted environment, the file storage would have to be absolutely massive and absolutely fast.<p>An interesting note is that Autodesk started out with Autocad, which they coded in lisp (eventually transformed into autolisp.)  They took the MS model to software development and proceeded to make bigger and more complex versions with increasing quantities of bugs to the extent that multiple crashes per day were the norm.  But they owned 80% of the world cad market, they became the 2nd largest software company in the world.<p>Revit was developed by a small company with an incredibly sound software architecture with a database at the core(without the massive bandaids that had piled up in Autocad and are still there today.) and developed a devoted cult following.  Autodesk fought back with ""Architectural Desktop"", which I bought (before I knew about Revit).  Their version:  Cut a section through a building, wait 30 minutes.  Revit, Cut a section through a building - instantly.  Autodesk got very scared, then bought Revit.

The idea was to develop a web based operating system for people that have never used or are uncomfortable with current computers. We had initially envisioned it as a product bundled with hardware but decided we would be unable to finance that, so we'd start with just the software.<p>Of course, the YCs immediately understood that the associated hardware was an important part. They suggested that a good starting point was an ""internet picture frame with email."" Instead of going with their suggestion, we defended our own.<p>They also spent a lot of the interview comparing our product to yahoo.com which was another direction we didn't think the interview would go.<p>In the end, we were rejected because we didn't have a functioning demo. It was a dumb move on our part, and I would say a demo is an absolute must for the interview. I really regret making it as far as we did and not having a demo. We threw away our opportunity. I've heard that one demo-less team was told at their interview to make a demo in the next 24 hours, so be prepared for a serious test of your ability to get things done if you don't have a demo. Being undergrads didn't help us either. If you're an undergraduate, make it clear to the YCs that you are absolutely committed to starting a company and that you intend to drop out and work on it whether or not you get funding from them.<p>For me, it's all moot because I got myself banned from Y Combinator after I made a really dumb Techcrunch comment. I've burned my bridges, but at least Paul lets me post here. :) One of my partners that didn't go to the interview was reading one of Paul's Lisp books at the time and commented on how surreal it was to be blacklisted by the guy who wrote the book he was reading.<p>When I was younger, I always separated the internet and internet-based friends from the real world.

My internet persona is me and actions in both worlds truly impact each other.<p>They also had really good drinks and cheese available. I could tell by the cheese labeled with the country of origin that Y Combinator was an amazing company.

Likewise with Firefox overtaking Internet Explorer, Thunderbird being the first to stand in for Outlook, and gcc has been the compiler of choice for years.<p>In summary, I agree that Microsoft is on the decline and that we are seeing software shift to the Internet, but I never think the desktop will go away.  The number of desktops running Windows and other Microsoft software, however, is going to continue to decline.  It's one thing to offer free software on the Internet alongside Google ads, it's another entirely to be able to install entirely free, ad-free software with no strings attached, which is an opportunity that the open source community has afforded us.",comment,

Tichy,,9983,,,1175939928,,"Personally, I categorize every application that updates itself as spyware. At the very least, the vendor of the software gets to monitor my habits of using my computer. Also I think this will become hell eventually when all the zillions of applications installed on a typical system try to update themselves after their own fancy.<p>It works so much better in debian/ubuntu, where most update requests go to a central repository. <p>Perhaps it would make sense to at least have one common ""updater"" component that all applications could use, similar to the way they now all use MS Installer (OK, sorry, I am still stuck with Windows, against my will). That updater component could be configured once, instead of having to configure each application individually. There is also the additional concern of letting applications communicate through a firewall - if I unblock them so they can get their bloody updates, who knows what else they will transmit?",comment,
theoutlander,,9985,[10122],,1175941701,,"I do like the ability to install on demand! Why is Windows leading client-side? Because it is easy! I am speaking from an average users perspective. Not us! I have used VI and I love it! Visual Studio is NOT like notepad. I'm sorry but AFAIK, VI or Emacs cannot provide intellisense can it? I have used both environments for development and based on my productivity, I concluded that Windows is a better environment for ME. Ultimately, it is about getting the job done FAST and using what works for you. I have used freeBSD and it is definitely STABLE, but really not something I would like to sit and develop on. Think about the millions of END-USERS??? Windows is really the solution for them... at least for now. Although Windows has its issues, I think Microsoft has improved its product in many ways. Do you realize how hard of a problem it is to solve, making the OS secure and user-friendly at the same time? I like Windows, Redhat and freeBSD... I wish Windows stayed away from the Server market and likewise Redhat stayed away from the client!",comment,
BrandonM,,9987,,,1175941823,,"I read about the fallout from that announcement sometime last year.  By announcing that they were giving back money to their shareholders, they opened the door for savvy stock market gurus.  These guys milked it for all it was worth by first loading up on the stock in order to get the cash from the dividends.  Because all these people were buying the stock, its price became artificially inflated, so they proceeded to borrow against the stock at this point (in order to short-sell later).  Then the dividends came, and they got the $3/share from Microsoft.  Immediately after this, they proceeded to sell the stocks that got them the dividends, which led to the stock price falling sharply.  Finally, to round it all out, they proceeded to make good on the short-sells once the stocks were low, leading to a nice profit all-around.<p>I wish I remembered where I read about this scheme; it sounded pretty brilliant to me.  I always wondered, though, if a bunch of people playing the stock market profited from this, who lost out?  I guess the long-time shareholders and Microsoft, itself.",comment,

mattjaynes,,9991,,,1175942443,,"Wow, this is awesome. Unfortunately it will probably be a good wait before this is built and released to the public.<p>In the meantime, I've been developing a framework using EC2, S3, S3DFS (DFS = Distributed File System) along with SQLite to try and solve the database problem on AWS. <p>S3DFS allows you to mount an S3 bucket to one or multiple EC2 instances as if it were a local filesystem. It works at the block level and has read/write caching - so is very fast. (Note: It's free to use for development, but otherwise requires a paid commercial license.)<p>Since SQLite uses flat files and has no database server or client, it is ideal for use on S3. SQLite only scales well to a point, so to get around its limitations I am separating each user into their own database (each database is a separate flat file). This can sometimes be a bad idea, but SQLite allows you to attach multiple databases together to essentially create a temporary master database where you can run queries across all the user databases at once. This will be handy for search indexing, site-wide stats, etc. In order to change the user databases I will have utilities to allow global scheme alterations.<p>So, by adding EC2 instances that are all attached to the same S3 bucket, and using round-robin dns to distribute traffic among them, you can theoretically scale a web service infinitely. Just launch a new EC2 instance and add it to the round-robin dns pool and you're done! Even that could be automated to respond dynamically to traffic.<p>Imagine the long-term cost-savings from only having to build your app and architecture once and not having to go through a more complex scaling process like this: <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/21793/Scaling-PHPMySQL-Presentation-from-Flickr"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/21793/Scaling-PHPMySQL-Presentation-from-Flickr</a><p>Certainly you should only worry about scaling after your app is up and running, but what if you didn't have to ever worry about it? That's the goal of this framework.<p>This is pre-alpha of course and I'm still in the development and experimentation stage, but I wanted to share with the community and get some feedback!<p><a href=""http://www.openfount.com/blog/s3dfs-for-ec2"">http://www.openfount.com/blog/s3dfs-for-ec2</a><p><a href=""http://www.sqlite.org/"">http://www.sqlite.org/</a><p><a href=""http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonEC2/gsg/2006-06-26/"">http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonEC2/gsg/2006-06-26/</a><p><a href=""http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/2006-03-01/gsg/"">http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/2006-03-01/gsg/</a><p>Update: Since this was so lengthy, I also added it as a post here: <a href=""http://blog.nanobeepers.com/2007/04/07/infinitely-scalable-framework-with-aws/"">http://blog.nanobeepers.com/2007/04/07/infinitely-scalable-framework-with-aws/</a><p>Update2: Please leave any feedback here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=10001"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=10001</a>",comment,

In general, SBCL has come a long way, partly due to companies that use CL (e.g. ITA) funding its development. CL is in many ways much more production-ready than it used to be for that reason. It still has rough spots, but my experience is vastly improved over what it was 1.5 years ago.",comment,
